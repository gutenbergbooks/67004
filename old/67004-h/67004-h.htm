<h2 class="nobreak">Introduction</h2>
</div>


<p>&#8220;<span class="smcap">The Young Continentals at Lexington</span>&#8221;
begins with that vital period of our country&#8217;s
history when the great forces that made the
Revolution were slowly coming together.</p>

<p>The port of Boston was closed; an army
under Gage occupied the city; Massachusetts
Bay was thronged with troop-ships and
frigates, and the colonies were writhing under
a series of unjust and oppressive laws.</p>

<p>It was at this time that the four boys who
play the leading parts in the story began their
experiences. Historical events that led up to
the war for independence are met with in
every chapter; the great personages of the
time figure upon almost every page. From
the meeting of the first Congress at Carpenter&#8217;s
Hall to the stand of the minutemen at Lexington
and Concord Bridge, every important
step in the movement for national life is
touched on.</p>

<p>The second book of the series, &#8220;The Young<span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">[4]</span>
Continentals at Bunker Hill,&#8221; takes up the
thread of history where this book leaves it.
It will show the siege of Boston, and the
glorious defeat on the Hill. It will tell how
Washington was given command of the army;
how he sent word to Ethan Allen; how the
heavy guns he captured at Ticonderoga were
hauled through the winter wilderness upon
sledges to Boston; also how Washington
mounted them upon Dorchester Heights and
finally drove the army of Gage from the city.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_I">CHAPTER I<br />


<small>SHOWS HOW BEN COOPER SAW THE WAR<br />
A LONG WAY OFF</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> smart little roan mare drew up at the
gate of the Cooper place, and Ben Cooper
leaned over and lifted the latch with the loop
of his riding-whip. The gate was still creaking
open when the lad noticed old Stephen
Comegies stumping along the road on his
gouty legs, and leaning heavily upon a stout
oaken staff.</p>

<p>&#8220;Good-morning, Mr. Comegies,&#8221; saluted
Ben, cheerily.</p>

<p>But old Stephen seemed not to hear; his
eyes were fixed upon the road, and his lips
were muttering; from the way his gnarled
hand clutched the staff, it would have fared
badly with those who had excited his anger
had they been in reach of its iron-shod foot.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[10]</span>&#8220;A fine morning, Mr. Comegies,&#8221; said Ben
Cooper.</p>

<p>This time he was heard. The old man
paused&mdash;leaned upon the staff and regarded
the boy from under his shaggy gray brows.</p>

<p>&#8220;A fine morning,&#8221; repeated he. &#8220;No!
That it is not. I see nothing fine in it.
But,&#8221; and his voice rose a pitch higher, &#8220;I
see a great deal of bad in it. I see a great
store of ill being laid up, for future days to
take care of.&#8221;</p>

<p>A slow smile stole over Ben Cooper&#8217;s round,
good-natured face. The whole of Germantown
called old Stephen &#8220;Grumpy Comegies&#8221;
and Ben had listened to him frequently before.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s fine weather anyway,&#8221; insisted Ben.
&#8220;The harvests are almost ready; the shooting
is going to be good; the rabbits and birds are
growing fat and plenty. What more can
any one want?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If they had any understanding,&#8221; replied
old Stephen, &#8220;they might feel sorry that
these colonies are being swept by a flood of ingratitude
to an honest king.&#8221;</p>

<p>Ben&#8217;s mouth puckered into a whistle of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[11]</span>
surprise; for Stephen Comegies was a man of
authority and weight in the community, and
it seemed odd that he should begin a political
discussion with a boy of sixteen years upon
the open road. However, the matter was
explained the next moment, when Ben heard
his father&#8217;s voice and saw him rise up from a
bench inside the gate where he had been
sitting with a book.</p>

<p>&#8220;I know, Mr. Comegies,&#8221; said Robert
Cooper, &#8220;that your words are pointed at myself
and not at the boy; so I will take them up.&#8221;</p>

<p>He leaned upon the fence as he spoke,
fluttering the leaves of the book with his
fingers. He was a tall, spare man with a pale,
studious face; but there was something about
him that was forceful and ready; an opponent
would never find him at a loss for either
words or actions.</p>

<p>&#8220;Can you deny that a spirit of unrest is
abroad?&#8221; demanded old Stephen, planting the
iron-tipped staff in the road. &#8220;Can you
deny that a rebellion is being fostered against
a generous prince? Can you deny that the
irresponsible firebrands in New England are
arming against their lawful rulers?&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[12]</span>&#8220;I shall not deny anything that you
charge,&#8221; replied Mr. Cooper sternly, &#8220;I shall
only say that it is all true, and further add
that I am greatly pleased to be able to
say it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Take care,&#8221; cried the old man, his gaunt,
once powerful frame quivering with resentment.
&#8220;Take care, Robert Cooper. You
and your like are sowing seeds of sedition
that can be reaped only by the bayonets of
the king&#8217;s regiments. You can flaunt your
scandalous theories of liberty in the faces of
your neighbors, but when the time for reckoning
comes you may not seem so ready.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I think,&#8221; replied Mr. Cooper, calmly,
&#8220;that when it does come, the reckoning will
find me ready enough.&#8221;</p>

<p>Old Stephen lifted his staff and shook it
tremulously to the southward.</p>

<p>&#8220;The broth that those vipers brew in Philadelphia,&#8221;
declared he, &#8220;will be the death of
them!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Those sent by the different colonies to
this Congress that is to meet,&#8221; said Robert
Cooper, &#8220;are honest American gentlemen.
They have wrongs that require redressing and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[13]</span>
they chose this means, as the best they know,
of procuring the remedy.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It is a threat,&#8221; maintained the old man.
&#8220;They are shaking a sword in King George&#8217;s
face. Why do they not beg redress of wrongs
like dutiful subjects, and not come together
like a lot of skulking rascals?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The time for begging has gone by,&#8221; said
Mr. Cooper. &#8220;From now on the colonies
will demand&mdash;and in a voice not to be mistaken.
We have submitted too long; the king
is an ignorant old man surrounded by incompetents.
There have been no more faithful
subjects than those of America; but they
will not permit themselves to be plundered.
If we are to be taxed we desire a voice in the
government that fixes those taxes.&#8221;</p>

<p>Stephen Comegies gazed at the speaker in
horror. That a man should cherish such
sentiments and still be permitted at large
filled him with wondering alarm. For a moment
he was unable to speak; then, recovering,
he burst out:</p>

<p>&#8220;This is not the first time I have heard
treason from you, Robert Cooper; and the day
is fast coming when you shall rue having<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[14]</span>
spoken it.&#8221; There was a pause, then he resumed
with a harsh laugh, &#8220;They will demand,
will they? And in a voice that will
not be mistaken, eh? Well, take care! It
is easy to send out a summons to draw a
rebel pack together, but it is not always so
easy to actually assemble them.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mr. Cooper gazed steadfastly into the deeply-lined
face of the old Tory; there was something
in the countenance threatening and
sombre, and somehow it gave out an impression
of hidden joy at some grim joke.
Mr. Cooper was about to reply, but old Stephen
gripped his staff firmly and moved a step or
two on his way. Then he paused and turned
his head.</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t forget what I have said,&#8221; added he,
with another cackle of laughter, &#8220;and don&#8217;t
say you were taken unawares.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then he stumped away upon his gouty legs,
the iron-shod staff ringing upon the hard
road, his big gray head bent and his lips
muttering their hatred of all the king&#8217;s enemies.</p>

<p>&#8220;He seems to be in a high temper this
morning,&#8221; laughed Ben, who had listened<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[15]</span>
with amusement to the Tory&#8217;s words. &#8220;But
he&#8217;s always crying out against something.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mr. Cooper shook his head.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m afraid,&#8221; said he, &#8220;that the coming
struggle will see the Tories one of our greatest
sources of vexation.&#8221;</p>

<p>Ben looked at his father in surprise.</p>

<p>&#8220;The coming struggle,&#8221; repeated he. &#8220;Do
you actually believe that it will come to that,
father?&#8221;</p>

<p>Mr. Cooper resumed his seat upon the bench
and opened the book once more. It was easy
to see that his fears were of the worst, but that
he had no desire to impart them to his son.</p>

<p>&#8220;All this controversy is a struggle,&#8221; he said.
&#8220;And as time draws on, it will grow more
bitter.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But,&#8221; queried Ben, his face alight with
anticipation, &#8220;do you think it will end in
blows being struck?&#8221;</p>

<p>But his father was bent over the book. All
he would say was:</p>

<p>&#8220;No one can predict the outcome of such a
thing.&#8221;</p>

<p>Ben waited for a moment, thinking he
would speak further; but as he did not, the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[16]</span>
lad shook the reins and Molly loped gaily up
the path and off toward the barn.</p>

<p>In the shadow of the coach house a broad-shouldered
youth of seventeen was engaged in
cleaning a long, shining rifle. He looked up
as Ben dismounted and turned the mare over
to a hired man.</p>

<p>&#8220;Good morning for a ride,&#8221; commented he,
as he rubbed industriously at the brass butt
of the weapon. &#8220;Wanted to go over my traps,
or I&#8217;d have joined you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You missed something,&#8221; replied Ben, as
he sat upon a sawbuck near the other. &#8220;The
air is fine upon the road.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I know,&#8221; smiled the other, &#8220;full of sunshine
and some other things which you can&#8217;t
see, but which make you feel like a giant.
It&#8217;s that way among the hills, up in the
Wyoming valley.&#8221;</p>

<p>Ben kicked at some chips with the toe of
his riding-boot and looked thoughtful.</p>

<p>&#8220;You <i>are</i> right,&#8221; he said, after a short pause;
&#8220;there are things in the air this morning&mdash;things
that maybe you don&#8217;t mean. And the
nearer I rode to the city, the stronger I felt
them.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[17]</span>The broad-shouldered youth laughed and
his gray eyes twinkled.</p>

<p>&#8220;Maybe,&#8221; said he, &#8220;they were bits of Mr.
Franklin&#8217;s electricity.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It might seem odd to you, Nat,&#8221; proceeded
Ben, without noticing the other&#8217;s light words,
&#8220;but I fancied that the roadside looked different.
Everything seemed closer together and
secretive, somehow. When the trees rustled
in the wind and nodded toward each other, it
seemed as though they were whispering mysteriously.&#8221;</p>

<p>Again Nat Brewster laughed.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ben,&#8221; said he, &#8220;I think you&#8217;ve passed the
glen where Mother Babette lives, and that
she&#8217;s put a spell upon you.&#8221;</p>

<p>But Ben paid no attention to the raillery;
his round, good-natured face was serious and
he went on soberly:</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course, I don&#8217;t think any of these
things are so. They are merely impressions
caused by something I did not notice at the
time.&#8221;</p>

<p>Nat looked at him with more interest.
The long rifle lay across his knee, and the
burnishing ceased.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[18]</span>&#8220;That&#8217;s so,&#8221; said he. &#8220;I&#8217;ve often felt like
that myself. Sometimes when I&#8217;ve tramped
alone among the mountains I&#8217;ve felt worried
about things that I couldn&#8217;t give a name.
And always something of importance turned
up afterward. It was just as though I felt it
coming a long way off.&#8221;</p>

<p>Ben nodded his head.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s it,&#8221; said he. &#8220;That&#8217;s it, exactly.&#8221;
He paused a moment, then continued, &#8220;All
along the road the people seemed quiet. Men
burning brush in the fields looked strangely
at me through the smoke. People in carts
who&#8217;d usually have something to say just
nodded their heads, and seemed to look after
me, watchfully. I passed the schoolhouse
there at the crossroads and the long drone
that always comes from it, of the scholars
chanting their lessons, was queer and hushed.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It was a strange sort of ride,&#8221; commented
Nat. &#8220;I wish I&#8217;d gone with you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I went as far as the &#8216;Bull and Badger.&#8217;
Some farmers were gathered in front of it and
some travelers were upon the porch. It was
the same with them as with the others. The
very inn seemed to be trying to contain some<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[19]</span>
weighty secret; and I turned and rode away
without even getting down.&#8221;</p>

<p>Ben leaned over and his forefinger tapped
his cousin upon the shoulder.</p>

<p>&#8220;I was at the gate of this place before I
found out what caused it all,&#8221; said he.</p>

<p>&#8220;What was it?&#8221; asked Nat, quickly.</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re going to have a war with England,&#8221;
replied Ben. &#8220;It means nothing else.&#8221;</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER II<br />


<small>TELLS WHY NAT BREWSTER WALKED TOWARD<br />
CLIVEDEN IN THE DARK</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Nat Brewster</span> settled his stalwart frame
back against the coach house wall and, wrinkling
his brows, regarded his cousin attentively.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s very likely you&#8217;re right,&#8221; said he at
length. &#8220;The expectation of such a thing
would act just about that way upon every one&mdash;even
to children and others who did not
understand.&#8221; Then he stretched out his long
legs and snapped the lock of his rifle with his
strong brown fingers. &#8220;If war does come,&#8221;
he went on, &#8220;I hope it comes quickly, while
the colonies are aroused to answer the call.
The whole of the north country is ready; and
from reports, the south and coast colonies are
also.&#8221;</p>

<p>There was a silence for a moment; then
Ben asked:</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[21]</span>&#8220;Do you think, if it came to blows, the
colonies would dare defy the king?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;They&#8217;ve done it before now,&#8221; replied Nat.
&#8220;Charles II tried oppression and his commissioners
were soundly beaten and shipped back
to England to him. James II patterned by
his brother in this, and his governor was first
imprisoned and then banished. If the colonies
were bold enough to do these things
when they were weak, they&#8217;ll do others like
them, now that they&#8217;re stronger.&#8221;</p>

<p>As Nat finished speaking there came a
clattering of hoofs and the rumble of wheels
upon a side road. Then a strong voice called:</p>

<p>&#8220;Who-o-e-e!&#8221;</p>

<p>The boys looked in the direction of the
sound and saw a light spring cart drawn by
four wiry little horses. A pockmarked man
with fiery red hair sat upon the seat; and in
his hands he held a sealed letter.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hello,&#8221; called he, in his loud voice.
&#8220;Come get this, some one. I can&#8217;t leave these
critters. If I did, they&#8217;d try to climb over
the barn.&#8221;</p>

<p>Ben arose and hurried to the fence.</p>

<p>&#8220;Something for us, Tom?&#8221; he asked.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[22]</span>&#8220;Something for you,&#8221; replied the pockmarked
man. &#8220;Was given to me at the City
Tavern last night.&#8221;</p>

<p>As he spoke the carter tossed the letter to
Ben, who deftly caught it; then he went on:</p>

<p>&#8220;I stopped there to get some things which
came in on the Baltimore coach for Mr.
Pendergast, above here. There&#8217;s a lot of
Massachusetts Bay people stopping there; and
one young fellow comes up to me:</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;I hear you carry goods up Germantown
way,&#8217; says he.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;I do,&#8217; says I.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Do you know the Cooper place?&#8217; says he.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;As well as I do my own,&#8217; I says.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Here&#8217;s a letter then,&#8217; he says. &#8216;And I&#8217;d
like it delivered with despatch.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;And with that he gives me a half crown
and the message, and tells me to keep the one
and give you the other.&#8221; The carter grinned
across at Ben good humoredly and added:
&#8220;Anything you want carried toward Whitemarsh?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I think not, Tom,&#8221; replied Ben.</p>

<p>&#8220;Good-day to you,&#8221; said the man. He
tightened the reins; the wiry little horses<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[23]</span>
sprang forward against their collars and the
cart went whirling away in a cloud of dust.</p>

<p>All the time the man was speaking Ben
Cooper&#8217;s face wore an expression of astonished
impatience. The astonishment was caused by
a glance at the handwriting upon the letter,
the impatience by the carter&#8217;s monologue.
But now that the man had gone, the lad
broke the seal and his eyes ran over the few
lines of writing which the sheet contained.
Then he turned and dashed back toward the
spot where he had left Nat.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ll never guess what it is,&#8221; cried he,
breathlessly. Then, without pausing for a
reply, he added, &#8220;Ezra Prentiss, of whom
I&#8217;ve told you so much, is in Philadelphia.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;In Philadelphia?&#8221; echoed Nat.</p>

<p>&#8220;Listen to what he says.&#8221; Unfolding the
letter, Ben read:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="right">&#8220;<i>City Tavern, Aug. 23.</i></p>

<p>&#8220;<span class="smcap">My dear Ben</span>:&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;I know this will astonish you. I&#8217;ve
come south with Mr. Samuel Adams and his
brother John, of both of whom you&#8217;ve no
doubt heard. They are here to attend the
Congress which is soon to meet at the Carpenter&#8217;s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[24]</span>
Hall. As you might guess, they were in
a great hurry as they came into the town and
I had no chance to call upon you. We will
be staying in the City Tavern; come in if you
can. In any event I will come to Germantown
in a few days.</p>

<p class="right"><span class="indentright">&#8220;Sincerely, your friend,</span><br />

&#8220;<span class="smcap">Ezra Prentiss</span>.&#8221;</p>
</div>

<p>&#8220;Mr. John and Samuel Adams!&#8221; said Nat
when his cousin had finished. &#8220;They are
the brothers who have spoken so boldly and
openly against the king. It seems to me,
Ben, that your friend keeps very famous company.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s a great patriot, you see,&#8221; explained
Ben. &#8220;Even while he was at school here
several years ago, he used to tell us of the
happenings at Boston and how the citizens
defied the government.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But I think you said his father was an
Englishman.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;His grandfather. His father is dead.
He never seemed to care to go deeply into his
family history; but he told me this: Some
years before his father&#8217;s death, there was some
sort of an outbreak&mdash;against the Stamp Act, I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[25]</span>
think. Ezra&#8217;s father sided with the townspeople.
But the grandfather was a Tory.
A bitter quarrel was the result and they afterward
no longer saw or spoke to each other.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I suppose there is a great deal of that,&#8221;
said Nat. &#8220;And if it comes to war, it will be
worse.&#8221;</p>

<p>They had now risen and walked toward
the house. Down the path along which Ben
had ridden in entering they saw Mr. Cooper
pacing to and fro, with bent head.</p>

<p>&#8220;That talk he had with old Stephen Comegies
has upset his nerves,&#8221; said Ben. &#8220;Politics
always has that effect upon him.&#8221;</p>

<p>As they walked up the step and into the
wide hall he related to his cousin what had
happened.</p>

<p>&#8220;I see,&#8221; said Nat, thoughtfully. &#8220;That is
what has fixed your impression of war.&#8221; He
looked at Ben steadfastly for a moment.
&#8220;Tell me again: What was it he said before
he left?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;As near as I can remember,&#8221; said Ben,
&#8220;he said: &#8216;It&#8217;s easy to <i>call</i> a pack of rebels
together, but not always so easy to actually
<i>get</i> them together.&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[26]</span>&#8220;And you say he seemed to have a sort of&mdash;well&mdash;a
look, while he said it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It was a satisfaction to him. I could see
that.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And then he bid your father not to say he
was taken unawares, eh?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Just as he was going,&#8221; said Ben. He
looked into Nat&#8217;s bronzed, thoughtful face
and was surprised at its expression. &#8220;Why,
you don&#8217;t think he really meant anything, do
you?&#8221; he asked.</p>

<p>Nat shook his head.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know. Sometimes crabbed old
men delight in making meaningless threats.
This may be one of them.&#8221;</p>

<p>He hung up his rifle upon a rack in the
hall and sat down in a broad seat at the door.
The beautiful suburb with its broad fields,
white roads and stately houses was stretched
out before him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Are there many Tories hereabouts?&#8221; he
asked, after a space.</p>

<p>Ben nodded.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; he replied, &#8220;a great many. And it&#8217;s
the same way in the city. With a very few
exceptions, it is only those who actually suffer<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[27]</span>
by the heavy taxes who are aroused and speak
against the government.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The people of consequence, as you might
call them, are then mostly Tories?&#8221;</p>

<p>Again Ben nodded.</p>

<p>&#8220;And they are proud of it,&#8221; said he.
&#8220;Though I must say I can&#8217;t understand what
they have to pride themselves on.&#8221; He
pointed across some prosperous grain fields;
behind a clump of heavy, thick-growing trees
could be seen the outlines of a rather fine
looking house. &#8220;That&#8217;s Cliveden, where the
Chews live,&#8221; he continued. &#8220;The Tories
meet there now and then and protest about
the growing disloyalty to the king.&#8221;</p>

<p>For a long time Nat Brewster sat gazing
straight ahead and pondering. Ben watched
him curiously for awhile, then as his cousin
said nothing more, remarked:</p>

<p>&#8220;I think after Molly&#8217;s rested I&#8217;ll ride into
town and see Ezra. He must be a regular
mail-bag for news. Will you come along,
Nat?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I think not,&#8221; replied the other.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve often spoken to him about you,&#8221; persisted
Ben. &#8220;He&#8217;ll be glad to see you.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[28]</span>&#8220;Another time will do just as well. I
hardly feel like going in to town to-day.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Very well,&#8221; and Ben turned away.
&#8220;Some other time then. But you must
know Ezra before he leaves. You&#8217;ll like
him.&#8221;</p>

<p>After Ben had gone, Nat clasped his hands
about his knees and continued to gaze across
the fields toward Cliveden. The August
sun was warm and the insects buzzed lazily
about in it, their wings a-glitter. The level,
fertile country was new to Nat; up north in the
Wyoming valley the rugged hills crowded
one upon the other; the grim, defiant forests
circled the settlements; the stony earth
fought stubbornly against the plow.</p>

<p>His mother had been Mr. Cooper&#8217;s sister;
she had met and married Nat&#8217;s father and
had gone with him into the wilderness to
make a home. But both were now dead.
Nat, whose mother had carefully taught him,
had served two terms as master in a log
schoolhouse. But the work did not altogether
please him; and when his uncle
sent for him to take him into his office, he
had gladly grasped the opportunity.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[29]</span>Even in the far Wyoming valley, the
growing discontent was felt; but the boy had
no notion that matters were so grave until he
arrived at Philadelphia and found neighbors
arrayed against each other and representatives
of the colonies scheduled to meet and pass
solemn resolutions protesting against England&#8217;s
unfair laws.</p>

<p>He ran over all his old impressions and his
new ones as well, as he sat in the wide doorway
of the Cooper house. And through all
his thoughts the saying of old Stephen
Comegies kept recurring.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;It&#8217;s easy to call rebels together,&#8217;&#8221; he repeated,
following Ben&#8217;s version of the saying
as well as he could. &#8220;&#8216;But it&#8217;s not always so
easy to get them together.&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>The boy&#8217;s thick black brows came together
in a frown and his locked fingers gripped his
knees closely.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t like that,&#8221; he murmured. &#8220;It
has a bad sound. It may have been the
angry, empty words of a partisan&mdash;and then
again, it may not. It would be a good thing
to have it looked into, I think, if it were possible.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[30]</span>And so this is why Nat Brewster waited
and lounged about for hours after his cousin
had ridden gaily away into the city; and it is
also why, just as the evening shadows were
deepening into darkness, he started across the
fields toward Chew House.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER III<br />


<small>SHOWS HOW NAT MET &#8220;GRUMPY COMEGIES&#8221; AND<br />
WHAT CAME OF IT</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">When</span> Nat had arrived at Germantown,
some weeks earlier, his place at the office was
not yet ready. In order not to be idle he had
gone to work in the fields with the hired
bands, and so still wore his backwoods
costume. A hunting-shirt, low about the
throat and coming almost to his knees, served
the place of a coat, while his leggings of
tanned deerskin and moccasins gave him the
air of one fresh from the wilderness, which he
was. But for all this homely dress he was a
fine, upstanding youth, broad-shouldered and
tall; his movements were as free and supple
as those of a savage, and his face wore the
look of habitual resolution that comes to
those who live in dangerous corners of the
earth.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s queer,&#8221; he said to himself as he strode
along, &#8220;that I can&#8217;t get out of the idea that I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[32]</span>
should take my rifle everywhere I go, as I did
at home. Somehow I don&#8217;t know what to do
with my hands when I haven&#8217;t it.&#8221;</p>

<p>To supply the place of the missing rifle he
stopped a little later and cut a good-sized
cudgel from a scrub oak; then once more he
started forward, whistling softly.</p>

<p>Further on, he found it necessary to vault
a fence into a narrow, tree-lined lane. Darkness
had now about set in; the lane, because
of its border of trees, was especially shadowy,
and some little distance away Nat caught the
yellow glow of a lantern as it came halting
and dancing along toward him. Leaning
back against the fence, he waited silently for
the person carrying it to advance.</p>

<p>Forward it came, hesitatingly, timidly, it
seemed. Nat at length made out the figure
of a man and that of a girl, and in a short
time they were close enough for him to catch
the sound of their voices.</p>

<p>&#8220;But, grandfather,&#8221; said the girl, and Nat
saw her look intently ahead in the lamp-light,
&#8220;I feel quite sure that I heard some
one.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Pish!&#8221; answered the man, impatiently.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[33]</span>&#8220;What if you did? The roads are free to
every one, are they not?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But just now,&#8221; persisted the girl, &#8220;it is
dangerous, is it not, with all this coming and
going of strange men? Indeed,&#8221; with great
candor, &#8220;I don&#8217;t like their looks any too
well.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Hold your tongue,&#8221; cried the man, angrily.
&#8220;It&#8217;s not for you to question the appearance
of loyal subjects of the king.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And do you think,&#8221; said the girl, &#8220;they
are really willing to&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Hush, I tell you!&#8221; The voice of the man
rose sharply and broke with the quaver of age.
&#8220;What talk is that to have in a public place?
For all you know, there may be a score about
to hear you.&#8221;</p>

<p>During the above, the pair continued
advancing along the lane in Nat&#8217;s direction;
and all the time the girl gazed ahead, trying
to pierce the darkness beyond the circle of
light. A ray from the lantern fell upon Nat&#8217;s
face as the old man spoke the last words, and
the girl halted with a sharp exclamation,
grasping his arm.</p>

<p>&#8220;What is it?&#8221; asked her companion.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[34]</span>&#8220;A stranger!&#8221; breathed the girl. &#8220;There
near the fence.&#8221;</p>

<p>The old man flashed the lantern in the direction
indicated; and Nat&#8217;s lounging figure
was bathed in its rays.</p>

<p>&#8220;What now, sir?&#8221; demanded the girl&#8217;s
companion, sternly. &#8220;What do you mean by
prowling around and startling decent people
in this way?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I beg your pardon,&#8221; said Nat, politely,
taking off his cap. &#8220;I just happened to be
passing.&#8221;</p>

<p>The old man peered into his face. He was
old, but his eyes were keen and bright; and
he studied Nat closely.</p>

<p>&#8220;Who are you?&#8221; he demanded. &#8220;I don&#8217;t
think I have seen you in this neighborhood
before.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Possibly not,&#8221; replied the boy. &#8220;I have
not been here a great while.&#8221;</p>

<p>An inquiring look came swiftly into the
deeply-lined face of the man with the lantern.
He bent forward eagerly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Perhaps,&#8221; said he, &#8220;you are from the north.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; replied Nat, calmly. &#8220;I am from
the north.&#8221;</p>


<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i_34.jpg" alt="" /></div>
<p class="drop-cap"><i>&#8220;WHO ARE YOU?&#8221; HE DEMANDED</i></p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[35]</span>&#8220;And you are going&mdash;&mdash;?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;To Chew House,&#8221; with great frankness.</p>

<p>&#8220;Good!&#8221; The old man burst into a cackle
of laughter, reached out and patted the boy&#8217;s
shoulder approvingly. &#8220;Excellent! But,&#8221;
with an admonitory air, &#8220;it would be as well
to mention no names.&#8221;</p>

<p>Nat had no reply for this, and so remained
silent.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am Stephen Comegies,&#8221; continued the
old man. &#8220;Perhaps,&#8221; with a great deal of
pride, &#8220;you have heard of me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I have,&#8221; replied the lad.</p>

<p>&#8220;There are a few who have not,&#8221; chuckled
&#8220;Grumpy Comegies.&#8221; &#8220;The king has some
friends who do not fear to speak their minds
to the rabble. And I would not let it end
with speaking,&#8221; he went on, with increased
spirit, &#8220;if I were twenty years younger.
There is not a lad of you all that would take
horse in the government&#8217;s service quicker
than I.&#8221;</p>

<p>Here Nat noticed the girl plucking the old
man&#8217;s sleeve. He bent impatiently down and
she whispered some quick words in his ear.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[36]</span>
But he shook his big gray head at her evident
attempt to check his garrulousness.</p>

<p>&#8220;Child,&#8221; said he, &#8220;leave men&#8217;s work to
men. I am old enough to know a friend from
a foe. And I will not hesitate to speak a
word of encouragement to one when I meet
him prepared to do dangerous work for his
master.&#8221; He turned to Nat and held out his
hand. &#8220;Your hand, lad.&#8221;</p>

<p>Nat extended his hand; the old man grasped
it in a way that showed that all his strength
had not departed from him, and said:</p>

<p>&#8220;If you and your comrades succeed in what
you are about to undertake, you will scatter
this rebellion like chaff. Have no fear; sweep
upon them and crush them out.&#8221; He turned
to the girl once more. &#8220;Come, child,&#8221; he
said. And as he started off he continued over
his shoulder, to Nat, &#8220;Good-evening, sir.&#8221;</p>

<p>They had gone barely a dozen yards when
Nat, who stood looking after them, saw the
girl leave old Stephen&#8217;s side and dart back
toward him.</p>

<p>&#8220;I do not know who you are,&#8221; she said,
&#8220;but you have an honest face.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Thank you,&#8221; replied the youth, smiling.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[37]</span>&#8220;My grandfather is a very old man,&#8221; she
continued in a breathless, hurried sort of way,
for old Comegies had begun to call rather
angrily to her, &#8220;and like most very old men,
he&mdash;he says a great many things that perhaps
he should not say.&#8221;</p>

<p>Nat bowed silently, in the shadows.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am glad you understand me,&#8221; continued
the girl, who perceived this despite the
thickening darkness. She drew closer to him
and lowered her voice. &#8220;If you are not what
he has taken you to be, I beg of you to be
generous and hold none of it to his injury.
Remember, he is, as I have said, an old man.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If it will ease your mind, mistress,&#8221; said
Nat gravely, &#8220;I promise to forget him in
the matter entirely.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Thank you,&#8221; said the girl, gratefully.
&#8220;Thank you. You are kind.&#8221;</p>

<p>And with that she darted away toward old
Stephen, who was holding up the lantern and
calling to her in his high-pitched, quavering
voice.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER IV<br />


<small>SHOWS HOW STARTLING NEWS WAS NAT&#8217;S REWARD<br />
AT CHEW HOUSE</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Nat Brewster</span> continued to watch the
lantern and the two whose way it lighted,
until the flame grew faint and flickering;
finally a bend in the road hid it altogether.</p>

<p>&#8220;So that is old Stephen Comegies,&#8221; he said.
&#8220;Well, I never thought I&#8217;d be pleased to see a
Tory, but I&#8217;m glad to meet this one; for
I think he&#8217;s clinched my belief that there is
some sort of a plot on foot against Congress.&#8221;</p>

<p>Through the trees he saw the winking windows
of Cliveden, and he regarded them
soberly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Some people from the north are expected,&#8221;
he continued, &#8220;and they are going there.&#8221;
He stood for a moment in silence; then suddenly
he threw back his head and laughed.
&#8220;I&#8217;m from the north, just as I told the old
man,&#8221; he said, &#8220;and,&#8221; clutching the oaken
cudgel firmly, &#8220;I&#8217;m going to Chew House,
also as I told him.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[39]</span>He clambered over the fence at the opposite
side of the road and started across the fields
once more. The dense growth of trees between
him and the mansion loomed blackly
before his face. There was a breeze stirring
and the boughs set up a warning whispering.</p>

<p>&#8220;There is no doubt of it,&#8221; said Nat, and he
laughed at the conceit; &#8220;the trees are on the
side of the colonies. This morning they told
Ben of coming war; and now they are doing
their best to make me keep my distance.&#8221;</p>

<p>However this might be, the young mountaineer
did not heed the warning, but went
steadily on. When once among the trees his
pace became slower; but finally he struck a
broad road, where the dim sheen of the sky
was visible through the branches.</p>

<p>&#8220;This evidently leads up to the house,&#8221;
muttered the lad. &#8220;It has the well-kept feel
of a private way.&#8221;</p>

<p>In this he was correct. It was not more
than a few minutes when the lights of the
house came into view; the broad windows
were like great yellow eyes and winked
genially out upon a wide lawn where flitting,
shadowy people came and went.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[40]</span>&#8220;Men,&#8221; said Nat, to himself, &#8220;and quite a
number of them.&#8221;</p>

<p>Cautiously he drew nearer; at length he
came to a low stone wall at the edge of the
road, and taking his place behind this, he
set himself to learn what was going forward.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ben said there were Tory meetings held
here,&#8221; he continued. &#8220;And I shouldn&#8217;t
wonder if this were one of them. And, perhaps,&#8221;
his grip tightening upon the club
which he still retained, &#8220;a very important
one, considering what Stephen Comegies
hinted at.&#8221;</p>

<p>After a little his eyes grew accustomed to
the wide beams of light with the shadows
thickening at their edges; then he began to
make out the figures upon the lawn as those
of men pacing backward and forward in
twos and threes.</p>

<p>&#8220;And very impatiently, I should say,&#8221; Nat
told himself shrewdly, as he watched the men.
&#8220;They act like persons delayed in something
which they are anxious to accomplish.&#8221;</p>

<p>The wall was at the far side of the lawn;
at first none approached it; but finally Nat<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[41]</span>
noticed a pair, who seemed even more impatient
than the rest, gradually coming nearer
and nearer as they unconsciously lengthened
their course at each turn in their walk. One
was a lean, stoop-shouldered man; the other
was tall and burly; their arms were locked,
their heads were close together and they
seemed to be discussing some exasperating
situation that had arisen.</p>

<p>Nat watched this twain expectantly.</p>

<p>&#8220;At the next turn they&#8217;ll get near enough
for me to hear what they are saying,&#8221; he calculated.
&#8220;Then, maybe, I&#8217;ll learn something
worth while.&#8221;</p>

<p>Sure enough, the next turn brought the
two within ear-shot. The first words that Nat
caught were from the burly personage, and
they made him catch his breath and shrink
closer to the wall.</p>

<p>&#8220;It would have been much better if we
had thought of this in time to intercept that
parcel of rascals from Massachusetts Bay,&#8221;
the big man said in a harsh voice that was
much like the grumbling of a dissatisfied
animal. &#8220;The ring-leaders of the entire
movement were in that party and with them<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[42]</span>
safely aboard a British ship, we&#8217;d soon have
them in England for trial and execution.&#8221;</p>

<p>As he spoke he slashed at his high boots
with a riding-whip and gave every evidence
of being in a towering rage. But the lean man
with the stooped shoulders spoke soothingly,</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t let your feelings get the better of
you, my dear Royce,&#8221; said he. &#8220;We must
have a beginning somewhere, and the Massachusetts
members of the rebel Congress were
already safely in the city when young Prentiss
suggested this idea to us.&#8221;</p>

<p>Prentiss! Nat Brewster heard the name
with a shock of recollection. But at the instant
the recollection was only as to having
heard it before. He mentally groped about
seeking to place it; then suddenly the facts
came to him like a flash.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s the name of Ben&#8217;s school friend,&#8221; he
thought. &#8220;Is it possible that&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; but he
drove the thought from him. &#8220;No, it can&#8217;t
be the same. There are many others of that
name, of course.&#8221;</p>

<p>The two men turned slowly and began to
retrace their steps.</p>

<p>&#8220;He should have communicated with us<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[43]</span>
sooner,&#8221; maintained Royce in his disagreeable
grumble.</p>

<p>&#8220;You may depend upon it that he made
all the speed he could,&#8221; replied the other.
&#8220;I never saw a lad more anxious about anything
than he was regarding the taking of
that firebrand Samuel Adams.&#8221;</p>

<p>Royce began speaking once more; but they
were too distant now for Nat to make out his
words; and the indistinct grumble died as the
men slowly paced away.</p>

<p>&#8220;Prentiss!&#8221; muttered Nat, still sternly
holding back the idea that tried to possess
him. &#8220;It&#8217;s an odd kind of a coincidence,
but that&#8217;s all it is. It can&#8217;t be Ben&#8217;s friend!
Why, of course it can&#8217;t,&#8221; with a relieved laugh
as another thought came to him. &#8220;This
Prentiss of whom these two were speaking is
eager to bring ill-fortune upon Mr. Adams,
while the one I&#8217;ve heard so much of since I
came to Germantown is his friend.&#8221;</p>

<p>But in spite of the laugh and in spite of
the reasoning, the similarity in the names
troubled the young mountaineer. And when
Royce and his companion drew near once
more, he listened eagerly.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[44]</span>The stoop-shouldered man was speaking and
considerable impatience had crept into his
voice.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is unreasonable and ungenerous,&#8221; declared
he, &#8220;to blame the boy for something
that is perhaps entirely out of his control.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Didn&#8217;t he say he was sure this was the
night?&mdash;didn&#8217;t he ask you to call us together?&#8221;
demanded Royce.</p>

<p>&#8220;He told me plainly that he was not sure;
he merely said that this would perhaps be the
night, and that it would be as well to have
everybody ready. You are angry because we
missed the opportunity to take Adams;
don&#8217;t lay everything to the lad&#8217;s discredit.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I will admit,&#8221; said Royce, &#8220;that there is
something in what you say. Of course he
doesn&#8217;t know just when the members from
Virginia are to cross the ferry, and he can
only notify us when he receives the information.
But I can&#8217;t get it out of my head that
he could have used more expedition in the
Adams matter.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You are a natural born grumbler,&#8221; said<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[45]</span>
the lean man. &#8220;I don&#8217;t think it would
be possible to please you, no matter what
was done. Young Prentiss did his best to
get here in advance of the men from Massachusetts;
and he did arrive in advance, as you
know.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But not far enough to be of any service,
Mr. Dimisdale, as you know,&#8221; insisted Royce,
stubbornly.</p>

<p>The two men had paused and leaned their
elbows upon the wall at no greater distance
than two yards from the spot where Nat was
crouched.</p>

<p>&#8220;I know the general estimate placed upon
the importance of these two Adams&#8217;,&#8221; said
Dimisdale.</p>

<p>&#8220;They are dangerous to the best interests
of the crown,&#8221; declared Royce. &#8220;They are of
the type of men who lead the people astray by
false doctrines. The country will never be at
peace while they are at large. Did not the
eldest of them&mdash;the one named Samuel&mdash;have
the effrontery to shake his fist in the
face of an English governor and warn him that
British redcoats&mdash;our safeguards&mdash;must be removed
from Boston. And all because a few<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[46]</span>
rebellious rascals had been shot in the streets
for an open defiance of the law!&#8221;</p>

<p>The indignation of the burly Tory as he
conjured up this scene almost made Nat
laugh outright, but he stifled the impulse as
Dimisdale began to speak.</p>

<p>&#8220;Please allow me to finish,&#8221; said that
gentleman. &#8220;When you interrupted me I
was about to show you that these two brothers
are not the only persons of consequence in
this movement.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Go on,&#8221; said Royce, sullenly.</p>

<p>&#8220;The prospects of our intercepting the men
from Virginia are good,&#8221; said Dimisdale. &#8220;If
we succeed, we will, beyond a doubt, have made
as important a capture, if not one of more importance,
than the one you so regret missing.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It will require a great deal to convince
me of that,&#8221; remarked Royce, with doubt
plain in his voice.</p>

<p>&#8220;First,&#8221; said Dimisdale, impressively,
&#8220;there will be Edward Pendleton, one of the
Virginia aristocrats, a man of fine distinction
and attainments, of many friendships and vast
influence in his own colony and far beyond to
the southward.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[47]</span>&#8220;I know that,&#8221; said the big man.</p>

<p>&#8220;Then there will be Patrick Henry, whose
name has already gone across the sea and
whose tongue is as a flame in arousing rebellion
among the discontented. And last&mdash;but
in my private opinion&mdash;standing head
and shoulders above them all&mdash;is one whom I
consider to be the most dangerous man
of the period. His very silence up to this
time makes him all the more to be feared.
His resolution is like granite, his talent beyond
dispute. I mean Colonel Washington,
of Mount Vernon.&#8221;</p>

<p>What Royce thought of this estimate
Nat never knew; for at that moment
there came the ring of hoofs in the darkness.
Then a horseman dashed up to the
Chew House and threw himself from the
saddle.</p>

<p>&#8220;Young Prentiss at last!&#8221; cried Royce.</p>

<p>&#8220;And come with news of importance, I&#8217;ll
be bound,&#8221; echoed Dimisdale.</p>

<p>The two hurried away toward the spot
where an eager group had gathered about the
newcomer; and Nat was left to his thoughts
and the darkness.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[48]</span>&#8220;An attempt to capture the Virginia
members of Congress,&#8221; breathed the boy,
his blood thrilling at the idea; &#8220;and to-night!&#8221;</p>

<p>He stared at the dim cluster of Tories who
stood in the path before the house listening
to something that was being swiftly imparted
to them by the night rider.</p>

<p>&#8220;And it may succeed,&#8221; he said. &#8220;It
is a thing so unsuspected that it may succeed!&#8221;</p>

<p>As he watched he saw the group scatter.
Horses were heard trampling and jingling
their equipment; then came the noise of
men mounting and calling to each other
triumphantly. Finally the entire party rode
down the path and into the public road; some
of them bore lanterns to light their way, and
in the dancing rays Nat saw eager, laughing
faces, and also the glint of steel. In the
midst of them rode a boyish figure; it was
the bearer of the news, but Nat could not see
his face, as it was turned away, the boy being
engaged in earnest talk with Dimisdale, who
rode beside him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Keep to the roads on the outskirts,&#8221;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[49]</span>
ordered Royce, who seemed to command the
cavalcade. &#8220;We might attract attention if we
rode through the city; and we can reach the
lower ferry just as well.&#8221;</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER V<br />


<small>HOW NAT BREWSTER MET THE PORCUPINE</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Bewildered</span>, and a trifle frightened by the
nature of the proceedings, Nat Brewster stood
by the low wall and listened to the hoof
beats as they died away in a muffled rumble.
But when the silence of the August night
closed in upon him&mdash;when he noted the
many lights of Chew House being extinguished
one by one, and heard the doors
and windows closing sharply, he suddenly
came out of his trance, and his naturally alert
brain began to work once more.</p>

<p>&#8220;Something must be done,&#8221; he said, aloud.
&#8220;And so it seems to have been left for me to
do, I suppose I must do it.&#8221;</p>

<p>Almost in an instant a plan of action was
drawn up.</p>

<p>&#8220;I must reach the lower ferry at the foot
of Gray&#8217;s Road before the Tories,&#8221; he told
himself, still speaking aloud. &#8220;But to do it
I must have a swift horse and one that can
stand a long run without breaking down.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[51]</span>That there was none such in the stable at
Coopers&#8217; he well knew; and instantly his
mind went to that of the Chews&#8217;.</p>

<p>&#8220;They are wealthy people and ride to the
hounds in season,&#8221; reasoned Nat, calling to
mind some gossip of Ben&#8217;s. &#8220;And so,
naturally, they have some good mounts in
their barn.&#8221;</p>

<p>He faced toward the great stone house as he
spoke, and in the darkness a smile came upon
his face.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t suppose they&#8217;d be willing to lend
if I went there and candidly explained what
I meant to do,&#8221; he proceeded. &#8220;So the best
thing I can do is to borrow first and take the
risk of explaining afterward&mdash;that is, if I can
find the barn in the dark.&#8221;</p>

<p>He sprang upon the wall and then down on
the other side. As he made his way
cautiously around the house he saw that
all the lights, save one at the front, were
out.</p>

<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s not much chance of my being seen&mdash;by
humans, anyway,&#8221; he muttered. &#8220;But
if they have any dogs about, they&#8217;ll be more
likely to scent me than not.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[52]</span>The words had scarcely left his lips when
there came a tremendous barking and the
swift rush of a heavy body toward him.
Luckily the brute was of a light color and the
boy caught a vague glimpse of it as it bounded
at him. Swinging the cudgel over his head,
he brought it down with a free, double-handed
sweep; there was a moaning yelp and the dog
lay motionless at his feet.</p>

<p>&#8220;A lucky blow,&#8221; said the young mountaineer,
as he jeered down at the stricken
beast. &#8220;But unlucky for you, old fellow,&#8221;
with a sudden qualm, &#8220;for I suppose you
were only doing what it was your nature to
do, after all.&#8221;</p>

<p>But he had little time for remorse. The
great door of Cliveden opened; a servant appeared
upon the threshold holding a light
above his head; a tall, aristocratic man stood
beside him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Are you quite sure it was the dog,
Henry?&#8221; asked the latter.</p>

<p>&#8220;Quite,&#8221; replied the servant.</p>

<p>There was a pause; then both bent their
heads as though listening: then the first
speaker remarked:</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[53]</span>&#8220;It was some passing noise, I fancy. He
seems quiet enough now.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, sir,&#8221; said the servant, who was a
stout, resolute looking fellow. &#8220;But had I
not better take a look about?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There is no need,&#8221; said the master carelessly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Very well, sir.&#8221;</p>

<p>Both withdrew, the servant casting suspicious
glances into the deep shadows about the
house. Nat drew a breath of relief.</p>

<p>&#8220;That was rather a narrow escape,&#8221; he
murmured. &#8220;From the way that fellow
looked, I felt sure he&#8217;d be out here poking
around with his light whether or no.&#8221;</p>

<p>Once more he cautiously made his way
around the mansion. Some little distance
away he caught the dense bulk of the barn;
and the same instant he noted that a dim
light was filtering through a small window at
one side.</p>

<p>&#8220;A watchman, perhaps,&#8221; thought the boy,
in keen disappointment. &#8220;If it is, that&#8217;s the
end of my plan.&#8221;</p>

<p>However, he carefully advanced and peered
through the window. A lantern hung upon<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[54]</span>
a wooden peg; there were some half dozen
horses in the stalls, but, as far as he could see,
no humans.</p>

<p>&#8220;In the loft, I suppose,&#8221; muttered Nat.
&#8220;More than likely a stable hand, sent to look
after the stock.&#8221;</p>

<p>He waited and watched for some time; once
the sound of a door opening caught his ear;
he turned and saw a barb of light flash along
the ground; then the door closed and the
light vanished.</p>

<p>&#8220;The servant, I suppose,&#8221; smiled Nat.
&#8220;He was not satisfied and took another short
look to assure himself.&#8221;</p>

<p>He waited for some time after this again,
but as there was no sound within the barn
save for the occasional stamp of the horses,
he finally walked quietly around to the door
and entered. A swift glance showed him
some horse equipment hanging at one side.
He took down a bridle and gave an appraising
look at the mounts.</p>

<p>&#8220;This one looks the best,&#8221; said he, softly;
and with that he slipped into the stall of a
powerful looking gray and bitted him with
calm expertness. He had backed the animal<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[55]</span>
out and was adjusting a saddle, when a queer,
squeaking voice, from directly over his head,
sounded in his ears.</p>

<p>&#8220;I thought you&#8217;d get the right one, master!
He&#8217;s a rare goer, he is!&#8221;</p>

<p>Nat started. His eyes went swiftly in the
direction of the voice. First he caught sight
of a comical little pair of legs astride one of
the rafters, then of a huge head, topped with
a shock of stiff, upstanding hair.</p>

<p>&#8220;There ain&#8217;t a nag in these parts that&#8217;ll get
you to the lower ferry quicker than that one
will,&#8221; continued the queer voice, assuringly.
&#8220;Always trust a flea-bitten gray to have courage
and bottom.&#8221;</p>

<p>Nat continued to hold the horse by the
bridle with one hand; with the other he
shaded his eyes from the light and examined
the speaker with interest. He saw a big,
moon-like face&mdash;a large mouth that grinned
down at him good-naturedly, showing two
rows of strong, white teeth. The creature&#8217;s
head was that of a man, but the body was no
larger than that of a ten-year-old boy.</p>

<p>The sudden discovery of this unusual
creature was in itself enough to startle a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[56]</span>
person with weak nerves. But Nat Brewster
was not troubled with anything of the sort.
It was the words alone that troubled him; the
odd-looking imp on the rafter seemed able to
read his secret purpose.</p>

<p>&#8220;Who are you?&#8221; inquired the mountain
boy, quietly, after a pause.</p>

<p>The dwarf grinned more widely than ever.</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t you know?&#8221; asked he. &#8220;Have
you been at the Cooper place for two weeks
and not heard of me?&#8221;</p>

<p>Nat shook his head. The dwarf blinked
his small round eyes as though marveling at
this lack of information. With one hand he
smoothed back his upstanding shock of hair;
but it sprang stiffly erect once more.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m the Porcupine,&#8221; announced he.
&#8220;Everybody knows me. I live in the woods
when I want to; but I mostly like barns and
such like, after the hay is in.&#8221;</p>

<p>Nat regarded him closely.</p>

<p>&#8220;What made you think I was going to
the lower ferry?&#8221; demanded he.</p>

<p>The Porcupine grinned; his large teeth
gleamed like polished ivory in the lantern
light.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[57]</span>&#8220;Folks don&#8217;t calculate I know much,&#8221; said
he. &#8220;But sometimes I fool &#8217;em. You didn&#8217;t
see me down there by the wall, did you?
Well, I was there, not more than a couple of
yards from you all the time.&#8221; The squeaky
voice pitched higher, as the dwarf shook with
gleeful recollection. &#8220;And I heard what
Master Dimisdale said to Master Royce; also
I heard what Master Royce said to Master
Dimisdale.&#8221; He leaned down from his perch
upon the rafter and shook his huge head with
increased enjoyment. &#8220;And right away I
knew what you were going to do.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How?&#8221; asked Nat, in wonder.</p>

<p>&#8220;When the party rode away and you stood
watching them, I heard what you said,&#8221; replied
the Porcupine. &#8220;That&#8217;s why I came
here. I wanted to see that you got a good
horse. And now that you have,&#8221; pointing to
a rangy looking chestnut that stood in a stall
almost beneath, &#8220;I want you to put a saddle
and bridle on that one for me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;For you!&#8221; said the astonished Nat.</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course, for me,&#8221; replied the dwarf,
coolly. &#8220;You&#8217;re a stranger here. How&#8217;ll
you find the lower ferry unless I show you?&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[58]</span>At this Nat burst into a laugh.</p>

<p>&#8220;Right!&#8221; said he, cheerily. &#8220;How would
I, to be sure? So get down and hold the gray
and I&#8217;ll saddle the chestnut for you in a
moment.&#8221;</p>

<p>The Porcupine slid himself along the rafter
dexterously until he reached the wall where
there was a ladder leading to the loft. Down
this he swung easily; and Nat watching him
for the first time noted the great length of his
arms and the size of his hands.</p>

<p>In a space the chestnut was beside the
other horse, champing its bit in a dissatisfied
sort of way. The dwarf, who scarcely came
to the shoulder of the tall gray, held it by
the rein and watched Nat&#8217;s accustomed
fingers approvingly as they flew from buckle
to buckle.</p>

<p>&#8220;So,&#8221; said the young mountaineer, as he
worked, &#8220;you are for Congress and against
the king, are you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; replied the Porcupine, &#8220;I&#8217;m only
against Neighbor Dimisdale.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And why against him?&#8221; asked Nat.</p>

<p>&#8220;Once there was a great robbing of hen-roosts;
they could not find out who was doing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[59]</span>
it, so Master Dimisdale settled upon me and
wanted me sent to the workhouse. He said I
was a vagrant and a danger to the town.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t look very dangerous,&#8221; spoke
Nat.</p>

<p>The dwarf grinned impishly.</p>

<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t know me yet,&#8221; he replied.
&#8220;But,&#8221; returning to his grievance, &#8220;Master
Dimisdale is a hard man. Even after I had
caught the real thief, he did his best against
me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And who was the real thief?&#8221; asked Nat,
surprisedly.</p>

<p>&#8220;A clever old mink,&#8221; grinned the Porcupine.
&#8220;I told them so from the first&mdash;but no
one would listen to me but Ben Collins. He
loaned me a trap and gave me a chance to
prove what I said.&#8221;</p>

<p>Nat put his hand upon the dwarf&#8217;s shoulder
and looked thoughtfully down into his face.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you understand the nature of the
errand upon which those men rode away a
while ago?&#8221; asked he.</p>

<p>The big head nodded; a shrewd look came
into the small, round eyes.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said the Porcupine.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[60]</span>&#8220;And you will help me prevent their carrying
it out?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m against anything that Neighbor
Dimisdale is for,&#8221; answered the Porcupine
promptly.</p>

<p>Without another word Nat led the two
horses out of the barn.</p>

<p>&#8220;Quick, now!&#8221; he said, in a low voice.</p>

<p>With a single heave he tossed the small
body lightly into the saddle.</p>

<p>The Porcupine clutched the chestnut with
his short legs and grasped the reins with a
practiced hand.</p>

<p>&#8220;Good,&#8221; said Nat, to himself. &#8220;He knows
what he&#8217;s about at all events.&#8221;</p>

<p>His own foot was in the stirrup when a
light suddenly flared in his face.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now then, my friend,&#8221; said a cold voice,
&#8220;give an account of yourself.&#8221;</p>

<p>For a moment Nat&#8217;s eyes were dazzled;
then he made out the countenance of the
speaker and that of the person who had so
suddenly unmasked the lantern. They were
the two who had come to the door of Chew
House but a short time before, attracted by the
barking of the dog. There was a superior<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[61]</span>
smile on the face of the master and a derisive
grin upon that of the man, as they noted the
boy&#8217;s astonishment.</p>

<p>&#8220;Your suspicions were correct, Henry,&#8221;
said the former, and Nat saw that he held a
large pistol ready in his hand. &#8220;And I thank
you for insisting, so to speak, upon a search.&#8221;</p>

<p>Nat recalled the sound of the door opening
and closing while he gazed through the
window of the barn, and realized that it was
then that they had emerged. Seeing that he
was caught he resolved to put a bold face upon
the matter and watch for any opportunity
that might present itself.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sincerely sorry to have disturbed you,
sir,&#8221; said he, politely.</p>

<p>&#8220;I can see that,&#8221; returned the other. &#8220;And
you were so anxious not to do so that you
were upon the point of borrowing my horses
to carry you out of ear-shot.&#8221;</p>

<p>Nat smiled at the quiet mockery of this.
He was about to speak, but the man servant
was before him.</p>

<p>&#8220;The lower ferry would be well out of ear-shot,&#8221;
remarked he with a laugh.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hold your lantern up, Henry,&#8221; commanded<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[62]</span>
the master; the man complied and
the rays fell upon Nat&#8217;s face once more.
&#8220;You hold your countenance well, my lad,&#8221;
continued the speaker, after a pause. &#8220;But
it will not serve you. We overheard your
conversation with this little villain,&#8221; nodding
smilingly toward the Porcupine, who had
during all this time remained silently perched
upon his tall steed. &#8220;And I think I&#8217;m safe in
saying that you&#8217;ll carry no warning to the
rebels to-night.&#8221;</p>

<p>Nat made no reply. Through his mind
ran thoughts of a dark, lonely road, of a quiet
party riding forward toward the city, of a
swift rush and capture, of a staggering blow
dealt the cause of the protesting colonies.</p>

<p>For a moment the man with the pistol
watched Nat&#8217;s face, then he turned with a
careless laugh.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now the rope, Henry,&#8221; said he. &#8220;I&#8217;ll
hold the light while you truss them up comfortably.&#8221;</p>

<p>But that moment of carelessness cost him
the success of his plan. The instant he
turned, Nat sprang upon him, wrested the
pistol from his clutch and felled him with its<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[63]</span>
heavy butt. With a squeal of excitement the
Porcupine drove his heels into the chestnut
and rode down the man servant, the lantern
being extinguished in his fall. Like a flash
Nat was upon the back of the gray, which was
snorting with fright, then with the dwarf at
his side he went leaping away into the darkness,
the horses&#8217; heads pointed toward the dim
glow that overhung the city.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER VI<br />


<small>SHOWS HOW NAT BREWSTER AND THE PORCUPINE<br />
RODE THROUGH THE NIGHT</small></h2>
</div>

<p>&#8220;<span class="smcap">This</span> way,&#8221; cried the Porcupine, after a
little. &#8220;Keep to the left; there&#8217;s a gap in the
fence at the far side of this field that will let
us out upon the main road.&#8221;</p>

<p>Nat followed the instructions of the dwarf,
whose knowledge of the ground about the
Chew House seemed perfect and whose sight
was unusually keen in the dark. The break
in the fence was located without any great
trouble, and a moment later found them with
the hard public road under them. Here
Nat drew rein; turning his head he gazed
back toward the mansion.</p>

<p>&#8220;It appears that we have created some little
stir,&#8221; remarked he to the Porcupine, who had
drawn up beside him. The dwarf uttered his
peculiar, squealing laugh.</p>

<p>&#8220;Look at the lights,&#8221; said he. &#8220;They pop
up at window after window, just like fireflies.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[65]</span>There was also the dim hubbub of far-away
voices; it was as though excited men were
calling loudly to each other, and that their
excitement grew greater with each passing
moment.</p>

<p>&#8220;In a little while they may recover their
senses sufficiently to take horse in pursuit,&#8221;
spoke Nat. &#8220;So I think we&#8217;d better make
the best of our time.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;d better make it anyhow,&#8221; suggested
the Porcupine. &#8220;We&#8217;ve a long ride ahead of
us and Master Royce&#8217;s party have had a good
half hour&#8217;s start.&#8221;</p>

<p>So together they gave their mounts the rein
and went galloping down the road. Steadily
the pace was kept up until the horses began
to show signs of distress. Then they were
allowed to walk until they had recovered,
when they were urged into a faster pace once
more. It was not a great while before they
rode into a more thickly built up section;
people were now frequently met with carrying
lanterns and proceeding about their business.</p>

<p>&#8220;And here is the city itself,&#8221; at last cried
the dwarf. &#8220;See the lamps,&#8221; pointing to the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[66]</span>
scattering of oil lamps which, owing to the
efforts of Benjamin Franklin, had been lately
placed in the streets. &#8220;They say there is no
town in all the colonies that has so many.&#8221;</p>

<p>The light thrown was dim and uncertain
enough; but Nat Brewster was struck with
admiration and looked wonderingly down
each street as they passed. He had been in
Philadelphia several times since his arrival,
but never before at night.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you know the town very well?&#8221; he
asked the dwarf, as they rode along.</p>

<p>&#8220;I was born in it,&#8221; replied that personage,
proudly. &#8220;And it is the largest city in
America. There are thirty thousand people
living here,&#8221; in a tone of almost incredulity,
&#8220;and there is a fast coach that makes the
journey to New York in two days.&#8221;</p>

<p>They turned at a smart pace through some
open ground into High Street, then across a
field and to the eastward of the State House
whose tower pointed darkly into the sky.</p>

<p>&#8220;Below here we shall soon come to Gray&#8217;s
Road, which leads direct to the ferry,&#8221; said
the dwarf. They rode on in silence for some
time after this. But the Porcupine&#8217;s manner<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[67]</span>
showed that he had something on his mind;
finally he twisted himself about in his saddle
and asked:</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s your name?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Nat Brewster,&#8221; was the reply.</p>

<p>&#8220;Nat Brewster,&#8221; repeated the other, slowly,
and with much the manner of a person who
is tasting something. &#8220;I kind of like the
sound of that; and,&#8221; suddenly, &#8220;I kind of
like you. But tell me this, Nat Brewster,&#8221;
tapping the young mountaineer upon the elbow
with one finger-tip; &#8220;when you come up with
Master Royce and his men, what do you intend
to do?&#8221;</p>

<p>For a moment Nat was startled. He drew
hard upon the rein and the big gray came to
a stand.</p>

<p>&#8220;You are right,&#8221; said he. &#8220;I&#8217;ve been in
such haste that the thing entirely escaped
me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You can&#8217;t fight &#8217;em alone,&#8221; spoke the
Porcupine wisely. &#8220;Of course,&#8221; with a grin,
&#8220;you won&#8217;t be exactly alone, but you might
as well be. I&#8217;m not much good in a fight.
I&#8217;m not big enough.&#8221;</p>

<p>Nat silently sat upon his horse and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[68]</span>
pondered. Royce&#8217;s men were heavily armed;
he knew that, for he had caught the glimmer
of steel in the lights of Chew House. And
that they were determined to carry out their
project in spite of all opposition, he felt sure.</p>

<p>&#8220;If I faced them,&#8221; the lad muttered,
&#8220;they&#8217;d laugh at me and cut me down.&#8221;</p>

<p>But he must have aid! He would turn
about and ride to the City Tavern where
those members of Congress, who had already
arrived, were staying. The idea was seized
upon eagerly; then almost immediately it
was discarded.</p>

<p>&#8220;It will take too much time,&#8221; thought the
young mountaineer. &#8220;And, another thing:
Would they believe the story I&#8217;d have to
tell?&#8221;</p>

<p>He was forced to admit that he did not
think so. The thing was improbable and
would be difficult to credit; valuable time
would be consumed, and in the end he&#8217;d
probably be forced to ride away as he came,
and proceed upon his mission alone.</p>

<p>&#8220;And with not so many chances of success,&#8221;
said Nat. &#8220;For while I&#8217;d be seeking
to convince strangers that I was telling<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[69]</span>
the truth, the Tories would have more than
likely accomplished what they set out to
do.&#8221;</p>

<p>A watchman&#8217;s lantern sparkled ahead as
the man raised it and tried to make out the
details of the two horsemen who stood so
silently in the middle of the street. A bell
struck midnight in a solemn, sonorous sort
of way; the watchman lifted his voice and
chanted:</p>

<p>&#8220;Twelve o&#8217;clock&mdash;a cloudy night&mdash;and all&#8217;s
well!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The time&#8217;s drawing on,&#8221; remarked the
dwarf. &#8220;Have you made up your mind?&#8221;</p>

<p>For answer Nat shook the rein and the
gray sprang forward; after a few bounds the
chestnut was alongside once more, and the
dwarfs peculiar, squealing laugh sounded in
the silence.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s what I thought you&#8217;d do,&#8221; declared
he. &#8220;I can always tell what people will do
by their faces.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; replied Nat, good humoredly,
&#8220;if you can see my face in this light, I must
say that Porcupines have remarkably sharp
eyes.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[70]</span>&#8220;I can&#8217;t see it now,&#8221; said the dwarf, composedly.
&#8220;But I could the other day when
you were breaking the colt for Farmer Campbell
in the back lot. There&#8217;d been a dozen
tried to ride that young beast before you came
to Germantown, and it threw them all. I
heard tell that it almost killed Peter Corbin.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It was somewhat self-willed,&#8221; said Nat,
recalling the desperate battle he&#8217;d had with
the creature before it was subdued. &#8220;But
you can expect that of colts, as a rule.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, but they&#8217;re not all as wicked as that
one,&#8221; and the Porcupine&#8217;s voice had a tone of
great positiveness. &#8220;I&#8217;ve seen lots of them
broken, but that colt fought harder than all of
them put together. But you didn&#8217;t ask any
one to help you when it threw itself down and
tried to roll on you, or when it tried to crush
your leg against the fence. You just stuck to
it and won. I knowed then, by your face,
that you&#8217;d do it; and I know now, even when
I can&#8217;t see it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You have confidence, at any rate,&#8221; laughed
Nat. &#8220;And so,&#8221; rather grimly, &#8220;I&#8217;ll try and
live up to your judgment of me.&#8221;</p>

<p>Some distance to the southwest they came<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[71]</span>
to Gray&#8217;s Road, and dashed along toward the
river.</p>

<p>As it drew on past midnight, it grew darker,
the sheen disappeared from the sky, a fact
which told them that the clouds were growing
thicker and that heavy rain might soon be
expected. The Porcupine sniffed as they
sped along.</p>

<p>&#8220;I can smell it,&#8221; said he confidently. &#8220;It&#8217;s
going to come from the direction in which we
are going.&#8221;</p>

<p>Just then Nat, whose eyes were fixed
steadily ahead, uttered an exclamation and
pulled up shortly. The dwarf instantly did
likewise. Both horses were thrown back upon
their haunches by the suddenness of the stop
and snorted with fright. Nat bent his head
forward, staring straight between the gray&#8217;s
ears and called sharply:</p>

<p>&#8220;Who&#8217;s there?&#8221;</p>

<p>In the silence that followed, the gurgle of
water lapping a bank was plainly heard.
Nat drew from the breast of his hunting-shirt
the heavy pistol which he had wrung from
the master of Cliveden; its clumsy mechanism
clicked loudly as he drew back the hammer.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[72]</span>&#8220;Who&#8217;s there?&#8221; demanded he, sternly.
&#8220;Answer, or I&#8217;ll fire.&#8221;</p>

<p>This time a low laugh followed the words.</p>

<p>&#8220;I suppose we&#8217;d better do as he asks,&#8221; spoke
a voice. &#8220;He said that as though he meant
it.&#8221;</p>

<p>The Porcupine leaned his big head toward
Nat.</p>

<p>&#8220;Master Dimisdale,&#8221; breathed he. &#8220;I&#8217;d
know his voice among a thousand.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We are peaceable citizens, sir traveler,&#8221;
said the voice. &#8220;And we trust that we have
not made ourselves offensive to you.&#8221;</p>

<p>Again came the low laugh; this time it was
slightly mocking and Nat&#8217;s anger began to
rise.</p>

<p>&#8220;You will kindly stand out of the road,&#8221;
said he, sharply. &#8220;I am not here to hold
conversation with you, whoever you are; my
business is more urgent.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And just what may your business be?&#8221;
inquired a boyish voice, which Nat at once
recognized as belonging to the person who had
laughed. &#8220;We have some small interest in
various matters to-night and who knows but
what yours might be one of them?&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[73]</span>&#8220;You can have no interest in me,&#8221; replied
Nat, evenly. &#8220;You know nothing of the
business that I ride upon.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Let us debate the question,&#8221; replied the
boyish voice. &#8220;Who knows but what our
knowledge is greater by far than you&#8217;d suppose.
It is a fact, and I&#8217;ll leave it to my
friends here to substantiate me in the saying,
that we have considerable interest in those
who use this road to-night.&#8221;</p>

<p>There was a chorus of laughter, low pitched
and cautious, at this. The shadowy persons,
who were stretched across the way, seemed
greatly diverted. Then Dimisdale spoke once
more.</p>

<p>&#8220;However,&#8221; said he, &#8220;we must remember
that these gentlemen are riding in the wrong
direction for us.&#8221;</p>

<p>Again came the laughter; above the others,
Nat could plainly hear that of the boy. And
somehow the sound greatly irritated him. As
a rule, Nat was not the lad for strangers to
make game of, and least of all was this the
case now. The cool, masterful tones of the
young stranger ruffled his temper in a way
that he could not have accounted for even if<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[74]</span>
he had tried. But when he spoke, no trace
of his anger crept into his voice; this was just
as even as before.</p>

<p>&#8220;You are disposed to entertain yourselves
at our expense, I see,&#8221; he said. &#8220;And, candidly,
I dislike it. So I ask you once more to
kindly stand aside that we may go on.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Go on!&#8221; came the boy&#8217;s voice. &#8220;Why
man alive, you should be thankful, indeed,
that we are here to prevent you from going
on. A dozen steps more and you&#8217;d be
swimming for your life in the Schuylkill.&#8221;</p>

<p>The sound of lapping water a few momenta
before had given Nat a hint as to this.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s the ferry landing,&#8221; he told himself.</p>

<p>Almost at the same moment he heard the
Porcupine whisper in his ear:</p>

<p>&#8220;They are waiting here for the gentlemen
from Virginia to cross the river.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Hush!&#8221; breathed Nat, fearing that the
words would be overheard. Then aloud he
said, addressing the invisible people before
him:</p>

<p>&#8220;I suppose you have taken up your present
position through motives of kindness entirely.
The fear that some heedless wayfarer<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[75]</span>
might ride into the river has kept you all out
of your beds, no doubt.&#8221;</p>

<p>Again came the laugh from the party blocking
the road.</p>

<p>&#8220;Our traveler has wit!&#8221; mocked the unseen
boy. &#8220;I&#8217;ll even venture that he&#8217;s as
clever a debater as either of the Adamses, or
Patrick Henry himself.&#8221; He paused a moment
and then addressed Nat once more:
&#8220;Perhaps it&#8217;s your intention to cross the
river?&#8221; said he.</p>

<p>&#8220;Perhaps,&#8221; replied Nat.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m very sorry, in that event,&#8221; returned
the other in his cool, exasperating way.
&#8220;But the ferry has just this moment&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>He had gotten this far when there came a
sudden movement; it was as though a hand
had been quickly clapped over his mouth.
Then Dimisdale was heard to say, quietly:</p>

<p>&#8220;A still tongue makes a wise head, Master
Prentiss. It is not always well to tell everything
you know.&#8221;</p>

<p>But he might just as well have allowed him
to continue, for even as it was, Nat Brewster&#8217;s
quick mind had grasped the situation. He
had wondered from the beginning why he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[76]</span>
had not heard the voice of Royce; for that
gentleman was scarcely one to be present and
not be heard. But the heedless words of the
youthful Tory brought the truth to him in a
flash.</p>

<p>&#8220;Royce is not here,&#8221; reasoned Nat, to himself.
&#8220;He has taken part of the band and
crossed the river on the ferry. They have
made up their minds that it is best to attack
on the far side.&#8221;</p>

<p>The idea was startling; but he kept himself
well in hand. Dimisdale had begun to
speak again, and he listened eagerly.</p>

<p>&#8220;In times like these,&#8221; said Dimisdale, &#8220;one
should consider everything one says. There
is no telling what small matter inconsiderately
dropped might lead to some larger circumstance
entirely unforeseen.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You talk like a sage, Master Dimisdale,&#8221;
laughed the stranger youth, lightly. &#8220;But
there is a great deal of truth in what you say,
and I&#8217;ll try to be guided by it.&#8221;</p>

<p>While he was speaking, Nat bent toward
the Porcupine.</p>

<p>&#8220;Is there a ford anywhere at hand?&#8221; he
whispered.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[77]</span>&#8220;Some distance above,&#8221; answered the dwarf
in the same low tone.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you think you can find it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sure I can.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then hold yourself ready to run for it.&#8221;</p>

<p>The young Tory had continued speaking;
and now he lifted his voice for Nat&#8217;s benefit,
still, however, addressing Dimisdale:</p>

<p>&#8220;However, at the worst there is no great
harm done. These two gentlemen, whoever
they are, are going to remain our guests for
an hour or two.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t be quite so sure of that,&#8221; cried Nat,
through his tight shut teeth. Then with a
quick word to the Porcupine they wheeled
their nags and went tearing up the road in
the direction of the city. Behind them came
a confused hubbub; then the voice of Dimisdale
rang out clearly:</p>

<p>&#8220;Halt!&#8221;</p>

<p>But they paid no attention; bending low
in their saddles, they urged the galloping
horses to a greater speed. Then a pistol shot
sounded, followed by another and still another.
The heavy bullets flew wide, and Nat laughed as
he heard them &#8220;zip-zipping&#8221; among the trees.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[78]</span>&#8220;It takes a sharp eye to sight a pistol in
the darkness,&#8221; said he.</p>

<p>&#8220;And it&#8217;ll take just as sharp a one to find
the road that&#8217;ll take us to the ford,&#8221; declared
the Porcupine, as he strained his eyes ahead.
&#8220;But I rather think I&#8217;m going to do it, for
all.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Do your best,&#8221; said Nat. &#8220;A great deal
depends upon the next half hour&mdash;perhaps
the very lives of Mr. Henry and his friends.&#8221;</p>

<p>In a little while the sounds in the rear died
away. The Tories upon the river bank had
been dismounted; and apparently they did
not think it wise, in any event, to give chase.</p>

<p>A full hour was consumed in finding the
ford in the dark, and crossing the river;
but upon the far side they picked up the
ferry road once more and turned south. Nat
rode with his hand upon the butt of the
pistol; the Tories were somewhere ahead and
almost any moment might bring another surprise.
Suddenly the Porcupine spoke.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why,&#8221; inquired he, &#8220;do this Mr. Henry
and his friends travel at night?&#8221;</p>

<p>This very question had been intruding
itself upon Nat in a hazy sort of way for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[79]</span>
some time, but now he saw its point for the
first time.</p>

<p>&#8220;Is there any good reason for their doing
it?&#8221; persisted the dwarf.</p>

<p>&#8220;None that I know of,&#8221; replied Nat.</p>

<p>&#8220;Then I don&#8217;t believe they are doing it,&#8221;
said the Porcupine, positively. &#8220;I don&#8217;t know
much about things, and the Tories at Master
Chew&#8217;s seemed to think they would cross the
lower ferry to-night. But if it were left for
me to give an opinion, I&#8217;d say that they were
comfortably sleeping at Chester, if they are
anywhere near the city at all.&#8221;</p>

<p>Nat was silent. The suggestion opened up
a new view of the night&#8217;s latter developments,
and he examined them carefully.</p>

<p>&#8220;You may be right,&#8221; he said at length.
&#8220;Perhaps the Tories had some one on the
watch; and when they reached the river they
may have been told that there would be no
crossing attempted until morning.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s it,&#8221; said the dwarf, shrewdly.
&#8220;And then some of them went over in the
boat, while the others were left behind to
make sure.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What purpose did they have in crossing?&#8221;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[80]</span>
asked Nat. A thought had sprung,
full armed, into his mind, and he breathlessly
awaited the Porcupine&#8217;s reply.</p>

<p>&#8220;They have found out where the gentlemen
are to spend the night,&#8221; came the dwarf&#8217;s
answer. &#8220;And they are going there after
them.&#8221;</p>

<p>For a moment Nat Brewster was too
absorbed to speak. The Porcupine&#8217;s reply
agreed so exactly with his thought that the
odd creature might well have read his mind.
At length, however, he asked:</p>

<p>&#8220;Is this the southern road?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The one the travelers would be likely to
take?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It is.&#8221;</p>

<p>Nat stared straight ahead into the darkness.
A few heavy drops of rain were falling and
the wind had begun to blow in warm gusts.</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;d better go as we are,&#8221; he said, after a
pause. &#8220;And,&#8221; with a laugh that was full of
expectation, &#8220;I rather think that we&#8217;ll meet
with some further experiences on the road before
we are an hour older.&#8221;</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER VII<br />


<small>SHOWS HOW NAT BREWSTER MET WITH MR.<br />
WASHINGTON</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> two had ridden no great distance from
the river when, close to the roadside, they
came upon a small wooden house, from a
window of which a light was streaming.
This in itself was rather unusual in such a
place at such an hour; but, more surprising
still, they saw, through the window, a man
sitting upon a low bench hammering merrily
away at a piece of leather.</p>

<p>&#8220;A cobbler,&#8221; said Nat, surprised, &#8220;and at
work so late in the night.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;His customers must be in great haste,&#8221;
laughed the Porcupine. &#8220;They don&#8217;t give
the poor man time enough to get his natural
sleep.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I think,&#8221; answered Nat, who had brought
the gray to a stand in the road opposite the
window, &#8220;that it might mean more than
that. At any rate, it will do no harm to exchange<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[82]</span>
a word with this hard-pressed mechanic.&#8221;</p>

<p>They rode close up under the cobbler&#8217;s
window; he, roused by the trampling hoofs,
paused in his hammering and lifted his head.</p>

<p>&#8220;You work late, shoemaker,&#8221; saluted Nat,
genially. &#8220;Business must be over good.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You ride late, young sir,&#8221; replied the
cobbler, shrewdly. &#8220;And how is business
with you?&#8221;</p>

<p>Nat laughed. The night was warm, and
the small-paned sash was pushed up as far as
it would go, making easy conversation.</p>

<p>&#8220;My present business is a great deal of a
puzzle,&#8221; replied the boy. &#8220;And I think I
had better see the end of it before I pass any
sort of judgment.&#8221;</p>

<p>The cobbler was a small, dried-out looking
man of middle age. He had a weazened face
and cunning eyes; and yet there was something
engaging about him. He beat at the
thick piece of leather upon his lap-stone for a
moment, then laid down the hammer and said:</p>

<p>&#8220;There is no one on this side of the Schuylkill
that can outdo me in puzzles this night,
young man. And whatever your matter is,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[83]</span>
I&#8217;m quite sure that it can&#8217;t compare with the
situation that I find myself in.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why,&#8221; said Nat, and the watchful Porcupine
saw an eager look come into his face,
&#8220;I had not thought the making of boots so
exciting a trade.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It has nothing to do with the making of
boots,&#8221; replied the mechanic. &#8220;If it had, I
could understand it readily enough. It is
something else, and something most peculiar
when a man comes to examine it from its
different sides.&#8221;</p>

<p>Nat said nothing to this. He saw that the
cobbler had something upon his mind and
that he was most anxious to unburden himself
of it, even to a stranger who appeared at his
window in the night.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s best to let him take his own time,&#8221;
reasoned the lad. &#8220;If I begin to ask questions,
he might take the notion not to
speak&mdash;and somehow I fancy that I should
greatly benefit by what he has to say.&#8221;</p>

<p>The little shoemaker rubbed his stained and
calloused hands together reflectively; the thick
candle that burned in a sconce over his head
threw a bright light about his work-room, with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[84]</span>
its array of farmers&#8217; thick boots awaiting repair,
and its clutter of leather and tools.
Finally he spoke, and with the air of a man
who was asking advice.</p>

<p>&#8220;What would you think,&#8221; he inquired,
bending forward, &#8220;if you were sitting here
upon this bench, pegging away at a sole and
wondering what sort of fall and winter we
have coming upon us, when a very young chap
rode up, much like you have done, only it was
by daylight, and says to you:</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Is this Neighbor Parslow?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;It is,&#8217; says you.</p>

<p>&#8220;He tries to look careless like, but you see
at once that he&#8217;s keen for something; so you
go on pegging and pegging and let him take
his own time about his own business. So
after a while he says to you:</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;As I was riding along the river I saw a
rather smart looking barge.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Did you?&#8217; says you.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Yes,&#8217; says he, &#8216;and as I was told it was
your property, I&#8217;ve come to see you about it.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;It&#8217;s not for sale,&#8217; says you.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Oh, I don&#8217;t want to buy it,&#8217; he says,
quick enough. &#8216;I just want to engage it.&#8217;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">[85]</span>&#8220;&#8216;Very well,&#8217; says you. &#8216;That&#8217;s what I keep
it for; my charge is four shillings for the day.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;And how much for the night?&#8217; asks he.
And with that you see he&#8217;s a merry chap and
has an honest face.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;It&#8217;s seldom or never,&#8217; says you, &#8216;that
any one hires the barge for after dark, so I
don&#8217;t know about that.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Have your boat ready at ten to-night,&#8217;
says he briskly, &#8216;and you&#8217;ll earn a handful of
Spanish dollars.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;So at that you&#8217;re a little taken by surprise.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Do you want it for a pleasure party?&#8217;
you ask him, and he laughs again in a way
that makes you like him more.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;I don&#8217;t know but what you might call it
that,&#8217; says he. &#8216;I and my friends will take
great pleasure in it; but I have a suspicion
that there are some others who will not like
it so well.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;He looks at you closely,&#8221; continued the
cobbler to Nat, who was listening with great
attention, &#8220;and he sees that you&#8217;re not taking
to the idea very keenly. So with that he
whips out a leathern purse and counts out a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[86]</span>
sum of money upon the window sill such as
you have not seen in months.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;There,&#8217; he says, &#8216;is your pay in advance.
Have the barge at the ferry landing across the
river and await me and those who shall bear
me company.&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>The cobbler arose and came closer to the
window, brushing the scraps of leather from
his apron. He peered up at Nat with his
small eyes.</p>

<p>&#8220;Somehow,&#8221; he proceeded, &#8220;for all the lad
has an honest look and a merry laugh, you
don&#8217;t care to do what he asks. There seems
something secret about it. But at the same
time there is the money&mdash;all Spanish gold&mdash;on
the window sill, staring you out of countenance.&#8221;
The speaker paused a moment,
then asked earnestly: &#8220;Now, if all these
things happened to you&mdash;and remember you
are a poor man&mdash;what would you do?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I think,&#8221; replied Nat, &#8220;I would try to
earn the money.&#8221;</p>

<p>The shoemaker nodded and seemed much
relieved.</p>

<p>&#8220;There are some lads,&#8221; remarked he, &#8220;who
have more wisdom than their years give them.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[87]</span>
I think you are one of that stamp. That
is the very thing I did. Promptly at ten, for
it was a still night and I could hear the town
bells strike the hour, I was at the landing
upon the other side.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said Nat, so eagerly that the watching
dwarf gave him a warning prod with his
knuckles. &#8220;And what then?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No one was there,&#8221; replied the cobbler.
&#8220;And I wailed until eleven struck; then until
almost twelve. At length a great party of
riders came down the road. When a light
was struck I could see that they were all
armed and wore looks that boded no good to
somebody. This troubled me more than
ever; but I had scarcely a glimpse of them
when the youth who had engaged me told me
to recross the river, tie the barge up and hold
myself in readiness here until they wanted
me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Is that the last you saw of them?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No; the entire party&mdash;or so it seemed to
me, at any rate&mdash;crossed the ferry and rode by
here less than two hours ago.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I suppose,&#8221; said Nat, carelessly, &#8220;you had
no idea as to where they were heading?&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[88]</span>&#8220;Not the least,&#8221; replied the worried
cobbler; then as a sort of afterthought:
&#8220;Have you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How far is it to the nearest inn&mdash;on this
road&mdash;riding as we are?&#8221; Nat ignored the
question, as he had no desire to confide his
suspicions to the talkative mechanic.</p>

<p>&#8220;A matter of some six miles. Perhaps a
little more.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Perhaps your friends have stopped there;
if so we might get a glimpse of them.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And if you do and should see anything
that would make you think they&#8217;re trying to
entangle me with the king&#8217;s laws, it would be
a friendly act for you to ride back and give
me warning.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Take warning now,&#8221; said the dwarf,
speaking for the first time. His odd squeak
startled the shoemaker, who had apparently
not noticed him before, and the man stood
staring at the great head and small body in
something like wonder.</p>

<p>&#8220;If you want to avoid entanglements of
every kind,&#8221; proceeded the Porcupine,
smoothing his stiff crest, &#8220;take warning now
by what I&#8217;m going to tell you. Go quickly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[89]</span>
now and hide your barge somewhere along
the bank; then return, close up your house,
put out your light and go quietly to bed. In
that way you&#8217;ll be sure to do no wrong.&#8221;</p>

<p>The man seemed greatly struck by this advice
and nodded his head as though it pleased
him. Nat gathered up his reins and was about
to give the word when a thought struck him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Did you by any chance,&#8221; asked he of the
mechanic, &#8220;hear the name of the boy who
engaged your boat?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I did,&#8221; was the answer. &#8220;A large man
was speaking in a loud tone of voice as they
rode up to the ferry landing and he called
him Prentiss.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Thank you,&#8221; said Nat, and without
further words the pair turned and put their
mounts at a hard gallop down the road.</p>

<p>&#8220;I think I could name what use is to be
made of the barge,&#8221; said the dwarf after a
long pause.</p>

<p>&#8220;And I,&#8221; replied Nat. &#8220;If the Virginian
members of Congress are taken, they will be
put into it, sculled down the river and placed
upon the British vessel which is, no doubt, at
anchor there for the purpose.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[90]</span>&#8220;And I hardly think she&#8217;d wait to take on
any further cargo,&#8221; remarked the Porcupine,
wisely. &#8220;They&#8217;d up sail, and away for England,
a quick trial, a tall scaffold and a short
rope.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You are pretty near the truth,&#8221; replied
the young mountaineer, grimly. &#8220;I&#8217;m afraid
the British ministers would not give the
prisoners much of a chance for their
lives.&#8221;</p>

<p>The gusts of warm wind had been growing
heavier. And now the rain began to fall in
torrents. The two riders bent their heads,
doggedly and in silence. Before the storm
began objects had been made out with the
utmost difficulty; now the darkness grew all
but impenetrable; lakes and rivulets formed
in the road; the horses were given their
heads, as being the safer way, and stumbling,
snorting and shaking the streaming rain from
their manes, they pressed onward.</p>

<p>Nat never knew how much time had
elapsed or how far they had gone, when suddenly
he felt his companion tugging at his
sleeve. Lifting his head, he became conscious
of a warm, yellow glow. Turning, he saw<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">[91]</span>
the bright front of an inn, set back a little
from the roadside.</p>

<p>&#8220;And look!&#8221; said the Porcupine, forced to
lift his voice, that he might be heard above
the roar of the rain. As he spoke, he pointed
to a long open shed where a couple of wind-mad
lights were dancing. Nat saw a full
dozen horses, saddled and bridled and looking
as though they had but lately been hard
ridden.</p>

<p>The young mountaineer&#8217;s face expressed
the satisfaction that filled him.</p>

<p>&#8220;The inn of which the cobbler spoke,&#8221; said
he, &#8220;and Royce and his companions are inside.&#8221;</p>

<p>In a few moments the gray and the chestnut
were also beneath the shed; a couple of
stable hands took them in charge and began
rubbing the rain from their streaming coats.</p>

<p>&#8220;And now,&#8221; spoke Nat, when he saw that
they were being well taken care of, &#8220;let us
go inside; there is sure to be a good fire in
the kitchen where we can dry our clothes.&#8221;</p>

<p>But the dwarf shook his big head.</p>

<p>&#8220;Go in yourself,&#8221; said he. &#8220;You may be
needed. But I&#8217;ll stay here.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[92]</span>&#8220;But you are wet to the skin,&#8221; protested
Nat.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m used to that, and it will do me no
harm.&#8221; Nat was about to say something more,
but the Porcupine interrupted him. &#8220;There
may be some of Master Royce&#8217;s people who
know me,&#8221; said he. &#8220;And that would bring
suspicion, or at least direct attention, upon
you. So you see, it is best for me to be outdoors.
Another thing,&#8221; and a cunning look
came into the odd, round face of the speaker,
&#8220;I&#8217;m used to prowling around. I may be of
more service out here than you think.&#8221;</p>

<p>Seeing that his new friend was determined
to have his way in the matter, Nat said nothing
more upon the subject.</p>

<p>&#8220;But,&#8221; he cautioned, &#8220;keep your eyes
and ears open.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Trust me for that,&#8221; grinned the Porcupine.</p>

<p>Nat pushed open the heavy door and found
himself in a large, square, low-ceilinged room
with rafters and sanded floor. There were
heavy settees and chairs and tables standing
about and many rain-soaked coats hanging
upon the wall. The rain and wind together
had turned the night rather chill; a good-sized<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">[93]</span>
fire was burning in a wide-mouthed fireplace,
and a number of men were standing about it,
their bands behind them and their backs to
the blaze.</p>

<p>As the boy opened the door, the landlord,
a small, meek-looking man in a white apron,
was speaking.</p>

<p>&#8220;But, gentlemen,&#8221; he said, &#8220;you are well
acquainted with what is required of an innkeeper.
It is quite impossible for me to do
what you ask.&#8221;</p>

<p>The burly Tory, Royce, to whom these
words were apparently addressed, slashed his
tall boots with his riding-whip and stalked
up and down angrily. His heavy tread
sounded noisily upon the sanded floor; his big,
coarse-featured face was flushed.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now listen to me with attention, my good
fellow,&#8221; spoke he, wrathfully, and he pointed
the heavy whip at the landlord threateningly.
&#8220;We know little of what you call the duties
of an innkeeper and care a great deal less.
As for it being impossible for you to do what
ask&mdash;well, we&#8217;ll request you to reconsider
that.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The gentlemen when they came begged<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">[94]</span>
the use of the room,&#8221; said the other. &#8220;It was
to be strictly private. And I could not now
intrude others upon them.&#8221;</p>

<p>The angry, flushed face of Royce now became
fairly purple.</p>

<p>&#8220;Intrude!&#8221; stormed he. &#8220;Intrude! Do
you call our presence in your beggarly inn
an intrusion?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, sir, surely not,&#8221; the meek little innkeeper
hastened to say, lifting both his hands
in a gesture of protest. &#8220;I am quite overjoyed
to have you, sir; and also your friends,&#8221; with
a frightened little bow to the others, who stood
scowling at him menacingly.</p>

<p>Royce was about to reply to this when he
for the first time noted Nat, who still stood
near the door listening to the conversation
with attention. For a moment the Tory
scanned the boy; then he inquired sharply:</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, sirrah, what do you want?&#8221;</p>

<p>Nat shook the rain from his hunting-shirt;
then he removed his cap and tossed
the clinging drops with a flirt out upon the
floor.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t think,&#8221; replied he, after a pause
of some length, during which he smilingly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">[95]</span>
studied the growing fury in the big man&#8217;s
face, &#8220;that is any affair of yours.&#8221;</p>

<p>For a moment it seemed as though the Tory
would leap upon him and strike him down.
But perhaps it was the stalwart, strongly-made
figure with its wide shoulders and arching
chest that gave him second thought. At any
rate, he stood and glared; and Nat, as though
he had not noticed his anger, advanced quietly
toward him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Gentlemen,&#8221; spoke he, courteously, to the
men about the fireplace, &#8220;if you could make
room for me, I&#8217;d be extremely obliged to
you.&#8221;</p>

<p>Whether it was the calm, indifferent manner
of the lad, or something that they expected
of Royce that made them act as they did, it
would be difficult to say; at any rate, they
drew silently away toward the settees and
chairs at the side, leaving the fireplace to Nat,
while Royce stood inspecting him, enraged,
but mute.</p>

<p>Finally the man found his tongue once
more; but instead of bursting out in a blaze
of wrath, as all no doubt expected him to do,
he spoke quietly enough.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">[96]</span>&#8220;It seems to me,&#8221; he said, &#8220;that you are
rather forward and plain spoken for one of
your age.&#8221;</p>

<p>There was a sneer in his voice and a look
in his eye that were infinitely more dangerous
than his vented fury could be. Nevertheless,
Nat spread the dripping fringe of his hunting-shirt
to the blaze and answered him, smilingly:</p>

<p>&#8220;In my part of the country we grow rather
quickly, as I suppose people do in most wild
places. So if you find me rather beyond my
years, I beg of you, sir, to lay it to that.&#8221;</p>

<p>In spite of Nat&#8217;s seeming carelessness, he
was keenly watching all that went on about
him. For the first time he noticed the air
and dress of those who made up the Tory
party; and for all the slim acquaintance with
the section, he knew at once that the men
did not belong in or about Philadelphia.
Another thing: The queer face of the Porcupine
was pressed inquiringly against the
streaming panes of a side window; and beside
and above it were those of a number of
stable hands, who were frowning belligerently
at the unconscious loyalists. At the sight a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">[97]</span>
quick understanding of the situation came to
Nat and he smiled once more.</p>

<p>&#8220;I see,&#8221; thought he, &#8220;that the Porcupine
was quite right when he said that he was
used to prowling about and might be of
service outdoors. Those fellows look hardy
and courageous; and I&#8217;ll need them before
long, if I&#8217;m not mistaken in my reading of the
face of Master Royce.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And where,&#8221; inquired the latter, who had
been studying the young mountaineer in
silence after his last reply, &#8220;where might
that wonderful region be?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;In the north,&#8221; answered Nat. And as he
spoke the words, the saying of old Stephen
Comegies came to him like a flash. &#8220;In the
north,&#8221; he repeated, &#8220;where I think,&#8221; waving
his hands toward the others, &#8220;most of
your friends are from.&#8221;</p>

<p>Watching, he saw Royce suddenly catch
his breath; also there was a quick stir among
the other Tories; some of them even came to
their feet.</p>

<p>&#8220;You are a lad of remarkable observation,&#8221;
spoke Royce, after an amazed pause. &#8220;But
don&#8217;t you think it as well not to see too<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">[98]</span>
much?&#8221; a different note creeping into his
voice&mdash;a note that at once challenged Nat&#8217;s
attention.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know,&#8221; replied the boy, with the
same undisturbed air as before. &#8220;A good
outlook is not a bad thing to have; indeed, I&#8217;ve
found it of distinct advantage more than once.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Unless I am greatly mistaken,&#8221; said
Royce, &#8220;this will not be one of the times.&#8221;
He advanced until he was within arm&#8217;s
length of Nat, then resumed: &#8220;I asked you,
when you first came into this place, what you
wanted. The inquiry was made simply because
your presence was undesirable.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I think I understand,&#8221; replied the boy,
easily enough. &#8220;Persons who have particular
and urgent business don&#8217;t like to be intruded
upon.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m going to ask the same question now,&#8221;
continued Royce, his jaw set in a grim way,
&#8220;and this time I want a plain, straightforward
answer.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The night is wet,&#8221; said Nat. &#8220;I have
ridden quite some distance. And the lights
of an inn are always particularly attractive at
such a time.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">[99]</span>With a snarling sound the man made a
clutch at the boy&#8217;s throat; but Nat, with a
light, quick movement, evaded him. Then
he in turn shot out his hand and gripped the
Tory by the wrist. Though not much over
seventeen, Nat was as large as most men and
stronger than a great many, as Royce at once
discovered. The clutch upon the wrist was
like iron, and with a quick whirl, the young
mountaineer spun the man around.</p>

<p>&#8220;It would be as well, sir,&#8221; said he, &#8220;not to
lose your temper. It will hardly do you any
good, and may result in doing you considerable
harm.&#8221;</p>

<p>In weight the Tory was greatly the young
mountaineer&#8217;s superior. But his bulk was
soft, flabby, untrained and his breath scant.
On the other hand, Nat was hard, supple and
swift, with wind and endurance that would
carry him far.</p>

<p>What a struggle between them would have
resulted in was still to remain in doubt; for a
quick, forward movement of the followers of
Royce caused Nat to let go and step back, his
hand going to the butt of Mr. Chew&#8217;s pistol.
However, there was no need of immediate<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">[100]</span>
alarm, for the men, while their attitudes toward
him lacked nothing in hostility, seemed
to have something else in mind. They
whispered and argued with Royce, holding his
arms. He began by struggling and storming
at them and demanding that they set him free
that he might chastise Nat for his impudence
in resisting. But in a few moments he
calmed wonderfully.</p>

<p>&#8220;You are right,&#8221; said he, quietly enough.
&#8220;We have more important matters to carry
out. Gentlemen, I beg your pardon. I&#8217;m
afraid I have not kept my temper very well,
and have risked compromising our errand.&#8221;
He shook himself like a great dog; turning
once more to Nat, he said:</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll see to you in a few moments, my lad,
if you&#8217;ve the courage to remain.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I shall be at your service whenever you
are disposed to take the matter up,&#8221; replied
the youth from the Wyoming.</p>

<p>Royce addressed the little innkeeper, who
had remained a silent spectator of all that had
passed.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now,&#8221; said he, coldly, &#8220;let us have that
door open,&#8221; indicating a door that apparently<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">[101]</span>
led into another of the inn&#8217;s public rooms.
&#8220;And let there be no further delay about it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But, my good sir,&#8221; protested the frightened
little man, &#8220;this is a much more comfortable
room. It&#8217;s larger and more airy.&#8221;</p>

<p>Without more ado, Royce threw him aside,
for the man stood between him and the door.</p>

<p>&#8220;Stand out of the way,&#8221; growled he. &#8220;I&#8217;ll
save you the trouble by opening it myself.&#8221;</p>

<p>His hand was upon the knob and he was
about to throw the door open, when a clear
voice cried:</p>

<p>&#8220;Wait!&#8221;</p>

<p>Royce and the others turned their heads,
startled by the suddenness and sharpness of
the command. Nat Brewster stood upon the
hearth facing them, and plain in view of all
was a long-barreled, shining pistol.</p>

<p>&#8220;Before you intrude yourselves upon those
people within here,&#8221; said the lad, firmly, &#8220;let
us have another word together, Mr. Royce.&#8221;</p>

<p>At the sound of his name the man started,
and he and his followers exchanged looks of
wonder.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; went on Nat, &#8220;I know your name;
and more than that, I know why you are here<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">[102]</span>
to-night. Also, if it&#8217;s any pleasure for you to
be acquainted with the fact, I know why Mr.
Dimisdale and some others hold the ferry
landing across the river; why a certain cobbler
awaited you in a barge and why a
British ship is anchored near the mouth of the
Schuylkill.&#8221;</p>

<p>Open-eyed, the Tories gazed at the daring
boy; while Nat laid the long barrel of the
heavy pistol in the hollow of his left arm and
regarded their amazement amusedly.</p>

<p>&#8220;And you&#8217;ve come here alone to tell us
that?&#8221; asked Royce grimly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Not altogether,&#8221; replied Nat. &#8220;I have
this,&#8221; and he held up his weapon. &#8220;You
may depend upon its being a serviceable arm,
for it is the property of Mr. Chew. Also,&#8221;
with a laugh, &#8220;I have some small reinforcement
without.&#8221;</p>

<p>Almost as he spoke, the main door swung
open and across the threshold, bearing uncouth
but effective looking weapons, trooped
a half score of stablemen and farm laborers.
With them was the Porcupine, rain-soaked
and with his stiff crest bristling with excitement.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">[103]</span>&#8220;There they are!&#8221; squeaked the dwarf.
&#8220;Stand to them, men!&#8221; And pointing to
the innkeeper, who was just rising from the
floor, he added, &#8220;Shall they do as they like?
See how they have misused the landlord.&#8221;</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i_103.jpg" alt="" /></div>
<p class="drop-cap"><i>&#8220;I &nbsp;ASK YOUR PARDON, MR. WASHINGTON&#8221;</i></p>

<p>The newcomers gripped their blunderbusses,
scythes and bludgeons tightly and were preparing
for a rush upon the Tories, when the
door which Royce had been about to open
was thrown back and a tall, superbly made
man stepped into the room. For an instant
his steady eyes swept the apartment; the sight
of drawn weapons seemed to occasion him no
surprise; he merely turned to the trembling
landlord and said:</p>

<p>&#8220;Sir, you said your inn was a quiet one,
and that we would not be disturbed.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I ask your pardon, Mr. Washington,&#8221; said
the frightened host. &#8220;Nothing like this has
ever taken place in my house before. I regret
it exceedingly, sir, indeed I do.&#8221;</p>

<p>As Mr. Washington once more directed his
steady gaze at the Tories and stablemen, Nat
addressed him quietly.</p>

<p>&#8220;I think, sir,&#8221; said he, &#8220;that the disturbance
is about over. This gentleman,&#8221; and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">[104]</span>
he bowed to Royce, who stood, a picture of
baffled fury, at one side, &#8220;has about discovered
that he&#8217;s made a mistake. At any rate,
he and his friends will intrude no longer, as I
think the landlord objects to their presence.&#8221;
He paused and waved his hand toward the
door leading to the road in a gesture that was
both an invitation and a command. &#8220;The
rain, I see, has somewhat slackened, Mr.
Royce,&#8221; he proceeded, &#8220;and you will no
doubt find your horses rested and ready.&#8221;</p>

<p>There was a short silence. Then Royce,
who had evidently no desire for a struggle
with the hardy workmen who faced him,
made a sign to his followers, and with never
a word they strode out into the night, the
inn people close at their heels.</p>

<p>And while the sounds of mounting and the
jeers of the onlookers came from without,
Nat Brewster stood upon the hearthstone before
the log fire and explained the situation
to the grave, attentive Mr. Washington.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER VIII<br />


<small>TELLS HOW THINGS BEGAN TO LOOK BAD FOR<br />
EZRA PRENTISS</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">It</span> was almost afternoon on the following
day when Nat Brewster and the Porcupine
reached Germantown once more.</p>

<p>&#8220;And now,&#8221; said Nat, with a grimace,
&#8220;what are we going to do with the horses?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We can dismount just above here,&#8221;
answered the ready Porcupine. &#8220;I&#8217;ll lead
them down the lane to a field that belongs to
Mr. Chew, take down the bars and drive
them in.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Excellent,&#8221; said Nat. &#8220;It couldn&#8217;t be
better.&#8221;</p>

<p>Accordingly they dismounted when they
came to the lane; the dwarf took the bridles
and prepared to carry out his plan; but before
starting he turned his head and said:</p>

<p>&#8220;I suppose I&#8217;ll see you again some time,
eh?&#8221;</p>

<p>Nat went to him, took him by the shoulders<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">[106]</span>
and looked down into his queer, round
face.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re not very big,&#8221; said he, &#8220;but
you&#8217;ve got courage and brains. And I thank
you for what you&#8217;ve done.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, never mind that,&#8221; grinned the Porcupine.
&#8220;I was thanked enough last night.
The hostlers thanked me for telling them
about how Master Royce and his friends were
bullying the landlord; and the landlord
thanked me for bringing the hostlers in.
And then the gentlemen from Virginia
thanked me for the other thing.&#8221; He paused
and looked up at Nat with shrewd inquiry.
&#8220;And so Mr. Washington won&#8217;t want us to
tell any one about the real reason for the
Tories being at the inn?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; replied Nat. &#8220;He thinks that it
would arouse indignation, and maybe bring
on some sort of an attack by the Congress
party. He says it is best to have nothing
of the sort now, for they have not yet given
up hope of bringing all Americans together
in their protests to the king.&#8221;</p>

<p>When Nat reached the Cooper place he
found that his absence had occasioned<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">[107]</span>
considerable alarm. But he led his uncle
and Ben quietly aside and explained the
business that took him away. To say that
they were surprised would be putting it
mildly.</p>

<p>&#8220;It was a clever and a dangerous plan,&#8221; said
Mr. Cooper, gravely. &#8220;It would seem that
men were brought from some point to the
north so that they would not be known in this
neighborhood. But,&#8221; with a laugh, &#8220;there
were by far too many in the secret. It is not
safe to tell anything of importance to such
rabid partisans as Stephen Comegies; for the
moment they lose their tempers, the truth
comes out.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s one thing,&#8221; said Ben, &#8220;that
pleases me most of all&mdash;of course, after seeing
the members from Virginia safe,&#8221; hastily.
&#8220;And that is that some one else has seen the
good qualities of that little imp, the Porcupine.
I&#8217;ve always contended that he was a
faithful and an honest boy; but I could get
few to believe me.&#8221;</p>

<p>A little later the two lads were alone pacing
up and down the lawn discussing the features
of Nat&#8217;s adventure. All the time&mdash;though<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">[108]</span>
he said nothing of it&mdash;one thought filled the
mind of the boy from Wyoming, and that
was as to Ben&#8217;s friend, Ezra Prentiss. In relating
his experiences he had not mentioned
this name, for he had not seen a way to bring
it naturally about.</p>

<p>&#8220;I must not hurt Ben by letting him see
that I am suspicious,&#8221; he thought. &#8220;The
suspicions are foolish and absurd, of course.
It could not have been the same person, for
while I was talking to one Prentiss at the
lower ferry, Ben was no doubt talking to the
other at the City Tavern.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I tell you, it&#8217;s all very wonderful here,&#8221;
said Ben, &#8220;and if I&#8217;d thought there was going
to be any such work, I&#8217;d never have ridden to
the city as I did.&#8221;</p>

<p>Nat laughed.</p>

<p>&#8220;I saw only three members of the Congress,&#8221;
said he, &#8220;while at the City Tavern I
suppose you saw a great many.&#8221;</p>

<p>But Ben grumbled.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, yes, I saw quite a few,&#8221; said he.
&#8220;But I didn&#8217;t see Ezra.&#8221;</p>

<p>Nat darted a quick look at his friend.</p>

<p>&#8220;You didn&#8217;t see him?&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">[109]</span>&#8220;No. They told me he&#8217;d been away all
day. And though I waited for him until
quite late in the night, he did not return.&#8221;</p>

<p>As he said this Ben chanced to look up and
caught the look that flashed into his cousin&#8217;s
face.</p>

<p>&#8220;What is it?&#8221; he asked wonderingly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, nothing,&#8221; replied Nat, quickly recovering
from the shock which Ben&#8217;s news
had given him. &#8220;I was thinking it rather
strange, that&#8217;s all.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I suppose he must have had some urgent
business,&#8221; Ben hastened to say in defence of
his friend. &#8220;Though it must have been a
private affair,&#8221; he added; &#8220;for I made bold
to stop Mr. John Adams and make inquiries.
Mr. Adams was much put out about Ezra&#8217;s
absence, for it seems that he had gone off
without warning. And, apparently, it had
not been the first time. It seems that Ezra
had left them much the same way on the
road between Bristol and the city.&#8221;</p>

<p>Once more a quick shock ran through Nat,
for he distinctly recalled the words of Dimisdale
and Royce. But this time he hid his
feelings and after a little thought asked:</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">[110]</span>&#8220;When will you be riding into town
again?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Perhaps to-morrow.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then I&#8217;ll bear you company,&#8221; said Nat,
quietly.</p>

<p>Nat spent the greater part of what remained
of the day in sleep; when he awoke, evening
was settling down once more; and as he
dressed he thought of the events of the preceding
night.</p>

<p>&#8220;It was all queer enough and unexpected
enough,&#8221; thought he. &#8220;But there is no part
of it that has the same surprising qualities as
the part played by this boy Prentiss.&#8221;</p>

<p>He stood for some time at the window
thoughtfully, looking across the fields and
woods toward Cliveden. In his mind he drew
up a r&eacute;sum&eacute; of the entire matter where it concerned
Ben&#8217;s New England friend.</p>

<p>&#8220;First Ben tells me that he has such a
friend,&#8221; thought Nat. &#8220;Then I learn he&#8217;s
strong for the rights of the colonies and
against the king&#8217;s ministers. Third, we find
that he&#8217;s unexpectedly arrived at Philadelphia
with Samuel and John Adams.&#8221; There was
a break in the marshaling of the facts at this<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">[111]</span>
point. &#8220;All these I hear through Ben,&#8221; proceeded
Nat. &#8220;But now let me come to the
things that I got from other sources. First, I
heard Royce and Dimisdale say that the idea
of the proposed kidnapping had been given
them by a youth named Prentiss, and I was
struck by the similarity of the names. However,
that was slight cause for suspicion, for
there must be many persons of that name.
Then I hear the same men say that the youth
is from New England, and that he has ridden
on ahead of the gentlemen who were coming
to attend the Congress, that he might have
them taken. Third, I hear of the plot against
the Virginians, and see the youth himself,
though in the shadow. Then I meet him at
the ferry landing in the night; and afterward
the cobbler tells me that he&#8217;s engaged a barge
which I knew was to carry the prisoners to
some English ship.&#8221;</p>

<p>Again and again the lad went over this
ground; but the result was always the same.</p>

<p>&#8220;It looks like positive evidence against
him,&#8221; he thought. &#8220;But it all could be
cleared up at one stroke if he had met Ben in
the city last night. His failure to do that,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">[112]</span>
and the fact that he had been gone all day,
seems to clinch the matter, so far as I can see.
Also, there is the circumstance of his mysteriously
leaving his employers upon the road to
Philadelphia. It seems to me that no amount
of reasoning can get beyond that.&#8221;</p>

<p>After making up his mind to this, Nat
Brewster descended to the floor.</p>

<p>He ate his supper in silence. At different
times his uncle or Ben addressed remarks to
him, but his answers were brief. Even his
aunt noticed it.</p>

<p>&#8220;Are you not well?&#8221; she asked, solicitously,
of him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, yes,&#8221; said Nat; &#8220;there is nothing
wrong with me, aunt, thank you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The dampness of the night air is apt to be
bad for growing boys,&#8221; said the good lady,
wisely; and her husband laughed.</p>

<p>&#8220;If Nat is still growing,&#8221; said he, surveying
his nephew&#8217;s breadth of shoulder, &#8220;I
don&#8217;t know what he&#8217;ll look like by the time
he&#8217;s done. We&#8217;ll have a giant on our hands,
perhaps.&#8221;</p>

<p>During the evening Nat continued thoughtful.
A dozen times he was tempted to speak<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">[113]</span>
to Ben regarding his suspicions, but each time
he checked himself.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is just possible that it was not the same
boy,&#8221; thought he. &#8220;And though I don&#8217;t expect
to find it so, still I&#8217;d better wait; something
may turn up that will convince me beyond
a doubt, one way or another.&#8221;</p>

<p>And so, directly after breakfast on the
following day, they saddled their horses to go
into town. Molly was in great spirits, champing
her bit and pawing at the stones in the
yard. Nat&#8217;s steed was a tall, raw-boned black
with a hard mouth and an uncertain temper;
but the young mountaineer was accustomed
to such, and got the beast ready, never giving
a thought to his evil qualities. A brisk
gallop through the sunlit morning brought
them to the nearer suburbs; then at an easier
pace they entered the city itself.</p>

<p>Philadelphia at that time was the largest
and most important city of the colonies. Its
population was timid in regards to throwing
a challenge into the teeth of the British
ministry, and were for a continuance of the
petitioning that had been going on for so
long. The fierce resentment of the people<span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">[114]</span>
of Massachusetts excited alarm in the City
of Brotherly Love; it, too, desired to be free,
but it wanted to go about the work in a more
Quaker-like fashion.</p>

<p>However, in spite of this decided feeling
of conservatism, the gathering of the first
Congress had stirred up considerable spirit in
the town, and as the two lads rode through
the streets they noted a movement and a pent-up
excitement that were unusual.</p>

<p>This was especially the case at the hostelry
called the &#8220;City Tavern.&#8221; Here men crowded
the entrances engaged in excited discussion;
others sat upon the heavy benches outside
the door and talked heatedly upon the great
event that was in a few days to befall the
colonies. As the boys got down and gave
their horses into the care of a stableman, they
caught some fragments of one of these debates
and stopped to listen.</p>

<p>A red-faced personage with a wart upon his
nose and holding a huge knotted stick, which
he pounded upon the pavement when he desired
to emphasize his remarks, was talking
to a mild-looking man whose peaked features
gave him a solemn look.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">[115]</span>&#8220;How,&#8221; demanded the red-faced man, &#8220;can
the protests of the colonies be heard if the
people don&#8217;t unite their voices as they propose
to do in this Congress?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But,&#8221; replied the peaked man, &#8220;the king
is short of temper: he may resent such a
step.&#8221;</p>

<p>The red-faced man grew redder still.</p>

<p>&#8220;Let him,&#8221; said he, heatedly. &#8220;And much
good it will do him. The people are aroused;
they have stood as much of this kind of
thing as they are going to. It must stop, sir!
It must stop!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But,&#8221; protested the mild-looking man,
&#8220;suppose it does not stop?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;In that event, sir, we will carry it further.
These colonies wore not settled for the purpose
of bringing gain to British merchants
and revenue to the treasury at London. No,
sir! They were settled that the settlers might
be free to conduct their own affairs as they
saw best.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But the king, the parliament, the ministry&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; began
the peaked man, but the
other stopped him with a snort.</p>

<p>&#8220;The king,&#8221; said the red-faced man, &#8220;is a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">[116]</span>
stubborn, ignorant old meddler; the parliament,
with the exception of Pitt and a few
others, are a parcel of incompetents, and the
ministry might well change places with the
clerks to the advantage of the empire!&#8221;</p>

<p>Warming up to his subject, and keeping his
stick beating a tattoo upon the red brick
pavement, the speaker went on:</p>

<p>&#8220;Look at the governors they send us, sir!
What imbeciles! They&#8217;ve tried to take away
the charters of Massachusetts, Rhode Island,
and my own colony of Connecticut. They
talk of establishing a peerage in America with
lords and earls and dukes, as grand as you
please. Our officers and men wrested the
country from the French, but they are held
in contempt by the British. An English
captain outranks an American colonel. Our
workmen are forbidden to make the nails that
go into the shoes of their horses; iron manufacturing
is declared a common nuisance; a
hatter in one colony is forbidden to sell his
hats in another, and is permitted to have only
two apprentices.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It is a difficult thing to bear these restrictions
upon the country&#8217;s natural trade,&#8221;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">[117]</span>
said the mild-looking man, his long face
growing more solemn. &#8220;But if the matter
were placed properly before the king, perhaps
he would see things in a different
light.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He will never see them in any light but
the one in which he now sees them,&#8221; declared
the red-faced man, positively. &#8220;The
British tradesmen have the government
under their thumbs; they fear the competition
of America and seek to make it dependent
upon them for everything. Did they not
drive Pitt out of office because he was disposed
to do us something like justice?</p>

<p>&#8220;Then there were their writs of assistance,
as they called them,&#8221; proceeded the speaker,
seeing that the peaked man was not disposed
to answer. &#8220;Any ruffian in the British service
could break into a man&#8217;s house and ransack
it from roof to cellar; and we were not
supposed to object. And even this was not
enough. They must needs saddle us with the
Stamp Act. No deed of sale or any other
legal paper could be made out unless drawn
upon stamped paper that cost anywhere from
threepence to six pounds. Then they clapped<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">[118]</span>
the tea tax upon us and sent an army into
Boston because it was resisted.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There was a great waste of a very
profitable article when they threw those
cargoes of tea into Massachusetts Bay,&#8221; said
the mild man, regretfully. &#8220;I have often
thought that they could have put their objection
into another form.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Be that as it may,&#8221; and the other smiled
grimly, &#8220;it&#8217;s closed the port of Boston as
tight as wax, ruined its merchants and placed
its population upon the verge of starvation.&#8221;</p>

<p>At this point in the discussion the two boys
moved away toward the door of the inn.</p>

<p>&#8220;I noticed when I was here the other day
that the New Englanders were the most
determined and outspoken in this matter,&#8221;
said Ben Cooper.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s because the greater part of the oppression
has so far fallen upon them,&#8221; replied
Nat, wisely. &#8220;I think you&#8217;ll find that the
other colonies will be in no way backward
when the time comes to act.&#8221;</p>

<p>Once within the inn, Ben inquired for Ezra
Prentiss.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">[119]</span>&#8220;He&#8217;s in the coffee-room, I think,&#8221;
answered the person asked. &#8220;Just walk in.&#8221;</p>

<p>There was quite a crush of men at the coffee-room
door; and as the two friends were
slowly making their way through it, a ringing,
pleasant laugh fell upon their ears. Nat
started at the sound and caught his breath.
Like a flash, the laugh brought back the experience
at the ferry landing; in every
quality and every tone it was similar to that
of the boy who had spoken to him from the
darkness.</p>

<p>&#8220;Did you hear that?&#8221; asked Ben, and his
cousin saw that he was smiling. &#8220;That&#8217;s
Ezra Prentiss as sure as you live!&#8221;</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER IX<br />


<small>NAT BREWSTER FINDS MORE PROOF</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> coffee-room was thronged; men sat
and stood about as they did in the other
rooms; here and there at tables parties were
at breakfast; there was also a great comparing
of papers and much secret conversing in out-of-the-way
corners.</p>

<p>No sooner had Ben and Nat entered than a
merry voice called:</p>

<p>&#8220;Ben Cooper!&#8221;</p>

<p>Then a hand struck the owner of that
name a most tremendous whack upon the
back; and turning, Ben found himself face
to face with his schoolmate from New England.</p>

<p>While the two were shaking hands in great
delight, and laughing and greeting each other,
Nat Brewster&#8217;s keen eyes were traveling over
Ezra Prentiss for any distinctive qualities
that would confirm his suspicions.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">[121]</span>&#8220;The height is about the same,&#8221; he told
himself, &#8220;as near as I can judge. However,
the one was sitting a horse and this one is
standing upon his legs. The general build is
also, I think, the same, though of course I
saw one in the shadow, or at best, the dim
light of a candle, and now see the other in
the full flood of the morning. There is a
good chance that I may be mistaken in both
these things. But in the laugh,&#8221; and Nat&#8217;s
eyes showed how sure he was, &#8220;I cannot be
mistaken. It&#8217;s the same. I could tell it anywhere
and any time I heard it.&#8221;</p>

<p>The boy from the mountains was still deep
in his reflections when Ben turned to him
quickly, saying:</p>

<p>&#8220;Pardon me, Nat, for forgetting you. But
I don&#8217;t see old friends like Ezra every day,
you see.&#8221; Then addressing the latter he
said: &#8220;This is my cousin, Nat Brewster&mdash;Nat,
this is the friend of whom you&#8217;ve heard
me talk so much about&mdash;Ezra Prentiss.&#8221;</p>

<p>Ezra&#8217;s eyes ran over Nat&#8217;s stalwart figure
in great admiration as they shook hands.</p>

<p>&#8220;I say,&#8221; said he to Ben, &#8220;here&#8217;s the chap
we should have had at the Academy. He<span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">[122]</span>
could have put Bully Harvey&#8217;s shoulders
upon the floor if any one could.&#8221;</p>

<p>They sat down at a window opening upon
the tavern yard. The two school friends soon
fell to rattling away about old experiences
and friends; Nat listened and studied the
newcomer closely.</p>

<p>&#8220;The cobbler near the river said that the
boy who engaged his boat had an honest look
and a merry laugh. So has this one,&#8221; as Ezra
Prentiss&#8217; laugh once more filled the coffee-room
and an expression of boyish glee crossed
his face at something Ben was saying. &#8220;I
never saw any one look more honest or more
worthy of confidence. And yet&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>Nat, try as he would, could not get beyond
the facts as he saw them. There was great
cause to suspect the young New Englander;
but, still, there was also something about him
that made such thoughts of him seem unjust
and ridiculous.</p>

<p>Frankness itself was in his eyes, and his
face was thoughtful looking even with its
merry expression. He was rather taller than
Ben Cooper and a trifle slimmer; but his
frame was well knit and strong. He talked<span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">[123]</span>
rapidly and with great spirit; his hands constantly
gestured to point his remarks, and his
white teeth shone in an ever ready smile.</p>

<p>Nat joined in the talk readily enough
when it touched upon subjects of which he
had any acquaintance.</p>

<p>&#8220;But,&#8221; said Ezra, at length, &#8220;it&#8217;s rather
close here&mdash;don&#8217;t you think so? Let&#8217;s go
outside. There&#8217;ll not only be more air, but
more to interest us.&#8221;</p>

<p>With that they arose and made their way
to the street.</p>

<p>&#8220;I never saw such throngs before,&#8221; said
Ben, his wondering eyes taking in the loitering people.
&#8220;It must be that the entire town
is out to greet the strangers.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s the first time, I suppose, that so many
have visited a colonial city at one time,&#8221; said
Ezra. &#8220;And the fact that they are from
twelve different provinces makes the occasion
all the more remarkable.&#8221;</p>

<p>Just then two horsemen rode out of the inn
yard; Ezra grasped Nat&#8217;s arm eagerly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Look,&#8221; said he, pointing to the riders.
&#8220;There is Patrick Henry, who made that
great speech before the Virginia Assembly,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">[124]</span>
and Colonel Washington, who saved Braddock&#8217;s
army from destruction in the wilderness.&#8221;</p>

<p>Ben Cooper gazed at those two famous
colonists with the utmost interest. In Mr.
Henry he saw a tall man with bent shoulders
and a strong face; in Washington, the athletic
figure and calm, powerful personality that
impressed every one who saw him. As the
two rode by the place where the boys were
standing they noted Mr. Washington say
something to his companion in a quick undertone.
The latter turned his head with a
look of interest and then both saluted Nat
Brewster gravely.</p>

<p>As the statesmen proceeded down the street,
Ezra Prentiss looked at the young mountaineer
in surprise.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, they seem to know you,&#8221; exclaimed
he.</p>

<p>Ben laughed at this; he was about to
speak, when he felt Nat secretly tug at the
skirt of his coat. Discreetly he kept silent.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; replied Nat quietly to Ezra. &#8220;I
have a slight acquaintance with the gentlemen.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">[125]</span>Ezra smiled at the tone used by his new
acquaintance.</p>

<p>&#8220;I thought I was going to have the pleasure
of pointing out all the notables,&#8221; said he.
&#8220;But I&#8217;m afraid now that I&#8217;m not.&#8221; Then
with a quick glance of interest, he added,
&#8220;Do you know any of the other members of
the Congress?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Mr. Pendleton only,&#8221; replied Nat.</p>

<p>At this he saw Ezra start; he also
caught a distinct change of expression.
But a moment later it was gone, and
the youth from Massachusetts Bay laughed
gaily.</p>

<p>&#8220;Good,&#8221; said he, &#8220;I&#8217;m not to be denied my
right after all. See there at the window,&#8221;
pointing to a small, earnest group. &#8220;They
are the two Rutledges and Christopher
Gadsden of South Carolina.&#8221;</p>

<p>A venerable man, with snowy hair, and a
tall, grave-faced gentleman stood near the
front door.</p>

<p>&#8220;The eldest is Mr. Hopkins of Rhode
Island, and the other is Roger Sherman of
Connecticut. And that man farther on, with
the fine high-bred face, is John Jay of New<span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">[126]</span>
York; with him are my two patrons, the
brothers Adams.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Which is which?&#8221; asked Ben, eagerly,
for the fame of the great Bostonians made
them persons to be asked after.</p>

<p>&#8220;Can you not tell that by simply looking
at them?&#8221; asked Ezra with a laugh. &#8220;John
is the shorter and the plumper of the two.
He&#8217;s the great debater and brilliant lawyer.
But Samuel is the grimmest fighter; look
at his stern, deeply-lined face and sombre
manner. He has not the ready flood of
eloquence of John, though he can speak
straight to the point when need be. But it
is his nature to be of the silent and relentless
kind&mdash;and I think in the long run he&#8217;s the
most to be dreaded by the British ministers.&#8221;</p>

<p>They talked for some time about the eminent
persons who were gathered around the
inn in small parties, preparing for the event
which was to prove so important for the nation.
At length Ezra, who had every now
and then stolen an odd, questioning look at
Nat Brewster, said to him:</p>

<p>&#8220;Have you known the members from
Virginia for any length of time?&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">[127]</span>&#8220;No,&#8221; replied Nat, briefly.</p>

<p>Ben was too much interested in looking
about him to pay any attention to what his
companions were saying. There was a short
pause, and Ezra, with an assumption of carelessness
that did not escape Nat, said:</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ve been something of a traveler
then?&#8221;</p>

<p>But Nat shook his head.</p>

<p>&#8220;Except for one journey into York State,
I&#8217;ve kept pretty close to the Wyoming valley
all my life,&#8221; he replied.</p>

<p>Ezra looked puzzled. That he would like
to have asked a great many questions was
plain; but that there was something that kept
him from doing so, was equally evident.</p>

<p>&#8220;It seems to me,&#8221; and the boy from New
England smiled as he said it, &#8220;that your
acquaintance with Mr. Washington and his
comrades is somewhat mysterious.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, no,&#8221; replied Nat. &#8220;It happened that
I was able to be of service to them a night or
two ago. That is how I came to make their
acquaintance.&#8221;</p>

<p>For a moment Ezra gazed steadily into the
speaker&#8217;s face.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">[128]</span>&#8220;A few nights ago,&#8221; said he, an odd note
in his voice.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; returned Nat, calmly. &#8220;It was
rather an urgently needed service; and it just
happened that I was at hand to render it.&#8221;</p>

<p>There was another pause, and then Ezra
spoke again, this time very quietly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Such things are sometimes long remembered,&#8221;
said he.</p>

<p>Nat nodded.</p>

<p>&#8220;And some people,&#8221; went on Ezra Prentiss,
in the same quiet way, &#8220;remember them to
advantage.&#8221; Seeing Nat&#8217;s questioning look
he added: &#8220;I mean that there are certain
dispositions that take great pleasure in rewarding
a good deed&mdash;and others that take
equal pleasure in repaying an evil one.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I suppose there are,&#8221; replied Nat, his eyes
never leaving the face of the other. &#8220;But,&#8221;
with a laugh, &#8220;the doer of good deeds can
rest in peace; and the other&mdash;well, he can
only be watchful.&#8221;</p>

<p>As these last words were being spoken Ben
Cooper turned. And now he broke in upon
them with a grin.</p>

<p>&#8220;I say,&#8221; spoke he, &#8220;what are you two<span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">[129]</span>
mumbling away about? And you&#8217;re staring
at each other like a couple of owls.&#8221;</p>

<p>In an instant Ezra&#8217;s face took on its usual
expression of good humor.</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t criticise us,&#8221; said he laughingly.
&#8220;You should see yourself. Your eyes have
grown so goggled through looking at so many
great men that it&#8217;s a wonder they don&#8217;t pop
out on the ground.&#8221;</p>

<p>All through the day Nat Brewster watched
Ezra Prentiss when he got the opportunity;
and deeper and deeper grew his impression
that beneath the merry laugh and ready good
humor there was a hidden something that
must not see the light.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a fear,&#8221; thought the young mountaineer,
as he and Ben mounted their horses
late in the afternoon and waved their hands
to Ezra. &#8220;It&#8217;s a fear. And, perhaps, a fear
that he may be shown to be a traitor to the
cause of the colonies!&#8221;</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER X<br />


<small>WHAT THE PORCUPINE SAW AT CHEW HOUSE</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">During</span> the days that followed, Nat Brewster
saw a great deal of Ezra Prentiss. One
day the latter would ride to Germantown.
On the next, perhaps, the cousins would go
into the city.</p>

<p>On September 5th, the Congress met for the
first time, at Carpenter&#8217;s Hall, with Peyton
Randolph, of Virginia, as its president and
with representatives present from every
colony except Georgia.</p>

<p>On the very next day, the famous Suffolk
resolves were passed at Milton, Massachusetts;
on the 17th a rider arrived in Philadelphia
bearing a copy of this document to the Congress,
and when a hint of the radical nature of the
resolutions became known, the city was in a
state of feverish suspense.</p>

<p>It happened that Ezra Prentiss had spent
the preceding night at the Cooper place; and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">[131]</span>
that day Ben and Nat rode in company with
him into the city. As they dismounted in
the yard of the City Tavern, Ezra noticed a
well-made, good-natured looking man of
middle age rubbing away at a powerful bay
horse.</p>

<p>&#8220;What!&#8221; exclaimed the young New Englander.
&#8220;Is it possible that it is Mr.
Revere?&#8221;</p>

<p>The man paused in his rubbing and looked
up. As he caught sight of Ezra, a cheery
smile overspread his face.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why bless my heart and body!&#8221; cried he,
&#8220;it&#8217;s young Ezra Prentiss, as large as life!&#8221;</p>

<p>Ezra hastened forward to shake hands with
the speaker. A hostler who took Nat&#8217;s
mount said in a low tone, in which there was
considerable respect:</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s the rider of the Suffolk Convention.
He&#8217;s made the trip from Boston in six days.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t wonder at it,&#8221; put in another one
of the inn&#8217;s people who stood idly by, chewing
at a long straw. &#8220;That&#8217;s a remarkable
animal he&#8217;s got there.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And he&#8217;s sure that it will get proper attention,&#8221;
grinned the first speaker, &#8220;for he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">[132]</span>
won&#8217;t let any one put a hand upon it but
himself.&#8221;</p>

<p>Here Ezra called to his companions and
introduced them to the despatch bearer.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m glad to make your acquaintance,
young gentlemen,&#8221; said he in a bluff, sincere
way. &#8220;If you&#8217;re friends of Ezra, I know
you&#8217;re friends of the colonies; and I want all
such to be friends of mine.&#8221; He paused a
moment and surveyed them carefully. &#8220;Are
you Sons of Liberty?&#8221; he inquired.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am,&#8221; replied Ben promptly, &#8220;and so is
my father.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The society has not yet reached the
back settlements,&#8221; smiled Nat. &#8220;So I am
not yet a member. But I hope to be before
long.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Good,&#8221; said Paul Revere, clapping him
upon the back. &#8220;Every true American
should be one of us. We are united in
hating tyranny and defying our oppressors.&#8221;</p>

<p>After the speaker had seen his steed
properly cared for and given particular
instructions as to how he should be fed,
he went with the boys into the inn.</p>

<p>&#8220;I gave my papers to Samuel Adams,&#8221; said<span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">[133]</span>
he to Ezra; &#8220;and even now the Congress is reading
them. And when their contents get out,&#8221;
rubbing his strong hands together and laughing
gleefully, &#8220;there will be some excitement,
I can tell you, young gentlemen; for Dr.
Warren, who offered the resolves to the
Suffolk delegates, does not mince his words.&#8221;</p>

<p>They sat in the coffee-room talking to
Revere while he awaited the return of Samuel
Adams from Carpenter&#8217;s Hall. He seemed
deep in the movement that was then convulsing
the colonies; every turn was familiar
to him; every New Englander who figured
conspicuously he could call readily by
name.</p>

<p>&#8220;But,&#8221; said he at length, &#8220;let me show you
some little things that have been thought to
hit off the situation.&#8221;</p>

<p>He produced as he spoke a number of
prints from his saddle-bag, which he had
carried into the coffee-room, and with honest
pride, began to point out their qualities.</p>

<p>&#8220;There is nothing like putting a thing before
the people in a way they&#8217;ll understand,&#8221;
said he. &#8220;And that is the intention of all
my work.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">[134]</span>&#8220;You are an artist then, Mr. Revere?&#8221;
said Nat, inquiringly.</p>

<p>The man smiled and waved his hand.</p>

<p>&#8220;Not much of a one, as the pictures themselves
will tell you,&#8221; answered he. &#8220;I&#8217;m
merely an engraver of copper plates. This
one,&#8221; indicating a particular print, &#8220;shows the
bloody massacre which took place in King
Street, Boston, four years ago. You&#8217;ve heard
how a party of the Twenty-ninth Regiment
shot down a number of honest people, I feel
sure. This one,&#8221; showing still another print,
&#8220;of the Dragon, met with quite a little
success at Boston and other cities.&#8221;</p>

<p>One by one he displayed the quaint
pictures and proudly read the pompous
verses which were printed on the margin of
each.</p>

<p>&#8220;The poems I wrote myself,&#8221; stated he,
&#8220;and while they may not be of the best, still
I take credit for them because I am no great
scholar. I had to give up school over soon to
go into my father&#8217;s shop to learn the trade of
gold and silversmith.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then you were not brought up an engraver,&#8221;
said Ben.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">[135]</span>&#8220;No. But, though I do say it myself, I
soon showed some art in fashioning ewers,
tankards, brasiers and mugs; and it is no
great step from that to the copper plate.
However,&#8221; and Revere smiled, &#8220;I have not
kept myself altogether to such work. When
trade was dull I took up other matters that
would be of service to the public, and incidentally,
to myself.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve heard tell that you once were a
dentist,&#8221; spoke Ezra.</p>

<p>&#8220;A sort of one,&#8221; replied the man. &#8220;At
least as much as John Baker, the surgeon
dentist, could make of me in a short time.
When I had my shop at the head of Dr.
Clark&#8217;s wharf,&#8221; to the other two, &#8220;I made
very good teeth for those persons who were so
unfortunate as to lose their own. Sometimes
the best in the city resorted to me. Once I
set a molar for Dr. Warren himself, and he
has ever since declared it even better than the
natural one.&#8221;</p>

<p>They were still engaged with this versatile
craftsman when a porter came into the coffee-room
and approached them. Addressing
Revere, he said:</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">[136]</span>&#8220;Mr. Adams has returned and is inquiring
for you, sir.&#8221;</p>

<p>Revere arose with alacrity.</p>

<p>&#8220;Where is he?&#8221; asked he.</p>

<p>But at that moment Samuel Adams, an exultant
light in his stern eyes, entered the
apartment.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, Revere,&#8221; said he, &#8220;I was this moment
seeking you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Something has been done!&#8221; cried Revere.
&#8220;I can see it in your face.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The resolutions of the citizens of the
county of Suffolk have been read to Congress,&#8221;
replied Mr. Adams, &#8220;and have been
received with the utmost approval. Even
now an answering paper is being drawn up
and will be passed upon at our earliest opportunity.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And you will commission me to carry it
back to Boston!&#8221; cried Revere, eagerly.</p>

<p>&#8220;To be sure. There is no one I would
trust farther&mdash;unless, indeed, it were Ezra,&#8221;
and he laid his hand upon the lad&#8217;s shoulder.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; laughed Revere, &#8220;I&#8217;ll not be
jealous of him, for I know that he&#8217;s served
both the cause and yourself well. He&#8217;s only<span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">[137]</span>
a lad, but many men might well be proud of
the work he&#8217;s done for the colonies!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I think,&#8221; here spoke Ezra, &#8220;that you are
both inclined to overestimate anything that I
have done. Every one has his opportunities,
and it is only his duty that he should accept
them as they come to him.&#8221;</p>

<p>They were still talking in this strain, and
Nat Brewster was listening wonderingly, when
the porter, who was lingering in the room,
touched him upon the arm.</p>

<p>&#8220;Are you Mr. Brewster?&#8221; he asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; replied Nat.</p>

<p>&#8220;There is a boy been asking for you&mdash;rather
an odd sort. He&#8217;s outside. Shall I
call him in?&#8221;</p>

<p>The porter&#8217;s words at once suggested the
Porcupine to Nat.</p>

<p>&#8220;But what in the world is he doing here?&#8221;
he thought. Then to the man he said: &#8220;I&#8217;ll
go out to him.&#8221;</p>

<p>As he turned away from the group in the
coffee-room he noted that the hand of Samuel
Adams still rested upon Ezra Prentiss&#8217;
shoulder. The whole attitude of the statesman
and that of Paul Revere were of perfect<span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">[138]</span>
trust and confidence in the boy; apparently
they would not hesitate to place their most
cherished projects in his keeping.</p>

<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t understand it,&#8221; thought Nat. &#8220;I
can&#8217;t, no matter how I try. Samuel Adams is
not a trustful man; he is more apt to suspect
than not. And Mr. Revere is not without
shrewdness. Both have known Ezra for a
long time, so it seems. They speak of him as
having rendered great services to the cause.
And, surely, they must know! It is not possible
that he can have hoodwinked them and
the many others in Boston who must have
watched his actions.&#8221; He paused in the
middle of the outer room, his mind filled with
these reflections. &#8220;I have known him but a
short time,&#8221; he went on, &#8220;and yet I have convinced
myself that he is&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; But here he
paused and shook his head. &#8220;No,&#8221; he said
aloud, &#8220;I&#8217;m not convinced. If I were I
would not be arguing with myself in this
way.&#8221;</p>

<p>When he reached the door of the inn he
found that the person inquiring for him was
the Porcupine, as he had fancied. The dwarf
was seated upon one of the heavy benches,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">[139]</span>
whittling a stick and whistling. At sight of
Nat he grinned widely and nodded his huge
head.</p>

<p>&#8220;What brings you here?&#8221; asked the young
mountaineer, as he shook him warmly by the
hand.</p>

<p>He had seen the boy once or twice since
their joint adventure, and had praised him so
highly to the family that in recognition of his
bravery Mr. Cooper had offered to employ
him upon the place. But the dwarf had
shaken his head.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t want to work for nobody&mdash;steady,&#8221;
he had replied. &#8220;I&#8217;d rather live around&mdash;just
as the squirrels do.&#8221;</p>

<p>Now he looked up at Nat and rubbed his
knife blade on the palm of his hand.</p>

<p>&#8220;I came to see you,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Went
over to Coopers&#8217; this morning and asked
for you. But they said you&#8217;d come into
town. And as my business is important,&#8221;
with a renewal of the grin, &#8220;I started in after
you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You didn&#8217;t walk!&#8221; exclaimed Nat.</p>

<p>&#8220;Not on legs as short as these,&#8221; returned
the dwarf. &#8220;It would take too long. I caught<span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">[140]</span>
the carrier as he came by, and as he&#8217;s a decent
fellow, he let me ride on top of the load.&#8221;</p>

<p>Nat sat down beside him on the bench.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; inquired he, &#8220;why did you wish
to see me?&#8221;</p>

<p>At once the face of the Porcupine lost its
grin. He resumed his whittling of the stick
and was silent for some little time. At length
he spoke.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ve only known me for a little while,&#8221;
he said. &#8220;Haven&#8217;t you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not very long,&#8221; admitted Nat.</p>

<p>&#8220;And of course when people don&#8217;t know
other people for any length of time&mdash;well, they
don&#8217;t put overmuch faith in them.&#8221;</p>

<p>Nat looked at him inquiringly. But the
dwarf kept his eyes upon the stick and
trimmed it delicately with his knife point.</p>

<p>&#8220;Go on,&#8221; said Nat.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s not very easy to go on,&#8221; said the Porcupine.
&#8220;Sometimes there are things that are
hard to say.&#8221;</p>

<p>There was another pause. Nat felt that it
was best to make no remarks. Apparently the
lad had something to tell him&mdash;something
that he thought would stretch his hearer&#8217;s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">[141]</span>
credulity&mdash;and he was diffident in beginning.</p>

<p>&#8220;But,&#8221; proceeded the Porcupine, at length,
&#8220;it&#8217;s got to be said and I&#8217;m going to say it.
Only, I want you to promise to believe me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Is it going to be as hard as all that?&#8221; said
Nat, smiling.</p>

<p>&#8220;Maybe it will be the hardest you ever
heard. I wouldn&#8217;t have believed it myself if
anybody had just told me. But I saw it. And
when you see a thing, you must believe it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, I suppose so,&#8221; said Nat.</p>

<p>The dwarf here threw down the stick and
placed his knife carefully in his pocket.
Then he drew his short legs under him much
after the posture of a Turk seated upon a rug.</p>

<p>&#8220;It was four nights ago,&#8221; he said, &#8220;that this
thing happened.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What thing?&#8221; asked the other.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll come to that in a minute,&#8221; answered
the Porcupine quietly. &#8220;You see I&#8217;d been in
to town here because I wanted to see the
people that were being so talked about; and
when I got back to Germantown it was late
and seemed about to come on rain. There
ain&#8217;t a great many places where I&#8217;m allowed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">[142]</span>
to sleep now, but I felt sure that Mr. Cooper
wouldn&#8217;t take it ill if I crowded into the hay-mow
in his barn for the night.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why didn&#8217;t you come to the house?&#8221; said
Nat. &#8220;You know they&#8217;d have found a bed
for you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, I don&#8217;t like to be a trouble to people.
And, then, as I said, it was late. But anyway,&#8221;
proceeded the dwarf, &#8220;I was on the
main road near Mr. Cooper&#8217;s; so I just crawled
through the fence, walked across the back lot,
and there I was behind the barn. There&#8217;s
always places where you can get into barns, if
you know how,&#8221; grinned the boy, &#8220;and I was
just hunting around for a door or window that
had been left open when I heard a dog bark.</p>

<p>&#8220;There are very few dogs &#8217;round about
Germantown that ain&#8217;t acquainted with me,
and there&#8217;s no occasion for me to be afraid
of any of them, for dogs never make any mistakes.
But, anyhow, I stopped and listened
because I thought there might be some one
stirring.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And there was?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, and in a very little while I knew
that he was coming in my direction.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">[143]</span>&#8220;Go on,&#8221; said Nat.</p>

<p>&#8220;I couldn&#8217;t see who it was,&#8221; continued the
Porcupine, &#8220;but I knew it was only one
person by the footsteps. I heard him stop at
the barn door and fumble with the catch for
a moment. Then I heard him say:</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Locked!&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;Now this was kind of curious, so I crept
quietly around the building on my toes. Just
as I reached the corner and peeked I heard a
tinder-box snapping, then there was a light
flared up, and I saw that the person at the
barn door was the boy who has been visiting
at Coopers&#8217; of late.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ezra Prentiss!&#8221; almost cried Nat, with a
start.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, that&#8217;s his name,&#8221; said the dwarf.
&#8220;The hired man told it to me the first day I
saw him around the place; and I&#8217;ve remembered
it, because it&#8217;s not a name,&#8221; meaningly,
&#8220;that I&#8217;m likely to forget.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I see,&#8221; said Nat. Then he added
quickly, &#8220;But you haven&#8217;t spoken to any
one about his name being the same as that
other?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; replied the other, promptly. &#8220;I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">[144]</span>
never do things like that until I&#8217;m sure of
them.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s right!&#8221; approved the young mountaineer.
&#8220;And now, go on.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The light only lasted a moment,&#8221; said the
Porcupine, proceeding with his story. &#8220;And
as it went out, I heard him say:</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Well, I can&#8217;t open that. So I suppose
I&#8217;ll have to walk.&#8217; He was still for a little
and then he went on: &#8216;But it&#8217;s not very far
off. I can cut across the fields, and it will take
me no time, if I don&#8217;t lose my way in the
dark.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;And with that he started off,&#8221; said the
Porcupine, &#8220;and, because of the sameness of
his name with that other one, I followed
him.&#8221;</p>

<p>Nat had a feeling that somehow this was
not altogether right. He detested spying and
anything like it; but for all that, his interest
was stimulated, as the story seemed to bear
directly along the line of his own suspicions.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; said he, trying to keep the eagerness
out of his voice and only succeeding indifferently
well, &#8220;where did he go?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Across the fields to Cliveden!&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">[145]</span>Nat felt something like a shiver run
through him. His feelings were that no
other proof of Ezra Prentiss&#8217; guilt was wanting.
But his reason and sense of justice told
him that he must not condemn, even yet.</p>

<p>&#8220;As I said,&#8221; proceeded the dwarf, &#8220;I followed
him. But in the trees upon this side
of Master Chew&#8217;s house I lost him.&#8221;</p>

<p>Nat drew something like a breath of relief.</p>

<p>&#8220;And that is all?&#8221; he asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;No.&#8221; The dwarf drew his little legs under
him more tightly and laid his large strong-fingered
hands upon his knees. &#8220;You know
after you lose a thing, you sometimes find it
again. So thinking of that I waited around
in the dark, near the stone wall where you
heard Master Dimisdale and Master Royce
talk on the night that we rode below the
ferry. But the boy didn&#8217;t show himself, and
as there was a lighted window at one side of
the house&mdash;the side where I knew Master
Chew&#8217;s office to be, I worked my way over to
it without any noise. The window was pretty
high for me, but there was a rain barrel almost
under it, and I climbed up that until I
stood upon the chime.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">[146]</span>&#8220;But,&#8221; questioned Nat, &#8220;what did you expect
to see?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know,&#8221; said the Porcupine. &#8220;The
light was in the window, and it was late at
night. That wasn&#8217;t usual, so I thought I&#8217;d
better not miss anything.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; said Nat, and once more the cold
feeling of dread crept over him, &#8220;what did
you see?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I saw,&#8221; replied the Porcupine, calmly,
&#8220;Master Chew, with the bandage about his
head which he&#8217;s been wearing since the night
you struck him with the butt of his own
pistol. I also saw Master Dimisdale, a pair of
glasses perched upon his nose, going over
some papers. Both sat at one side of the big
table in the center of the office. And across
from them, as cool as you please, and chatting
bravely away with Master Chew, was the lad
I&#8217;d been following!&#8221;</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XI<br />


<small>SHOWS HOW NAT BREWSTER SPOKE TO HIS UNCLE<br />
AND WHAT THEIR RESOLUTIONS WERE</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">As</span> Nat Brewster heard the Porcupine&#8217;s
statement, he was surprised and astonished to
find that quick words of denial sprang to his
lips. The truth was that the merry laugh
and honest face of Ezra Prentiss, which had
impressed the cobbler of the ferry road, had
also impressed Nat. And, not only that, Nat
had seen Ezra&#8217;s eyes, full of frankness and
friendliness, something that the worthy mechanic
had missed; and in spite of his
suspicions the young mountaineer felt drawn
toward the boy from New England.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s impossible!&#8221; were his first words.
&#8220;It simply can&#8217;t be! You were mistaken!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t forget what I told you at the beginning,&#8221;
said the dwarf. &#8220;I said it would be
hard to believe; I even said I wouldn&#8217;t believe
it myself just on somebody&#8217;s say-so.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">[148]</span>Nat gazed at the speaker in silence. That
the misshapen boy was sincere he had never
a doubt. But the sudden confirmation of his
own suspicions had startled him; he had
spent some days with Ezra, had come to like
him and so feared to follow where the facts
led.</p>

<p>&#8220;If I were convinced,&#8221; his inward thoughts
were, &#8220;I might act upon my conviction. I
might point this boy out as a traitor. And,
in the end, in spite of everything I&#8217;ve seen
and heard, he might still be innocent.&#8221;</p>

<p>The Porcupine here resumed.</p>

<p>&#8220;Also, I told you at the beginning that
the thing had to be said; and that&#8217;s why I
said it. But I wouldn&#8217;t have told any one but
you, for you and I are the only ones that
know about him being in the plot to take
Mr. Washington and the others&mdash;unless,&#8221; and
there was inquiry in the speaker&#8217;s little
eyes&mdash;&#8220;you&#8217;ve mentioned it to some others.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; replied Nat, hastily. &#8220;I&#8217;ve told Mr.
Cooper and Ben about our adventure, as you
know; but this fact of the name I&#8217;ve kept
clear of. You see, Ezra is a warm friend of
Ben&#8217;s, and I didn&#8217;t care to&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">[149]</span>&#8220;I understand,&#8221; said the other, as Nat hesitated.</p>

<p>&#8220;Even in the face of what you&#8217;ve told me,&#8221;
resumed Nat, &#8220;I hesitate to say anything.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then you believe what I&#8217;ve told you?&#8221;
eagerly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course I believe you&mdash;everything happened
as you&#8217;ve told it&mdash;everything! Ezra
Prentiss arose in the night while we were all
in bed, stole out of the house, made his way
to Cliveden and was seen by you in conversation,
in Mr. Chew&#8217;s office, with Mr. Dimisdale
and Mr. Chew himself&mdash;both of whom are
noted as friends of the British government.
Now,&#8221; continued Nat, &#8220;we know all this; but
are we quite sure that we know what it
means?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m quite sure that I do,&#8221; spoke the
dwarf, sturdily.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I am not,&#8221; said Nat.</p>

<p>And even while he spoke the words he
knew that he did not mean them&mdash;he knew
that he was equally sure. But there was a
something&mdash;an instinct, perhaps&mdash;that made
him fight the feeling back.</p>

<p>&#8220;It looks bad,&#8221; said he continuing, &#8220;in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">[150]</span>
fact, I am willing to admit that it looks as
though you were right. But let us wait. It
can do no harm, and it may do good.&#8221;</p>

<p>At this moment, Samuel Adams came out
of the inn accompanied by Ezra, to whom he
was speaking in low, confidential tones. As
they went on down the street, side by side,
the Porcupine puckered his eyelids and gazed
after them keenly.</p>

<p>&#8220;You say that waiting can do no harm,&#8221;
said he, &#8220;but I&#8217;m not so sure about that. I
know who that is,&#8221; nodding toward Mr.
Adams. &#8220;He was pointed out to me the
other day. And,&#8221; looking at Nat steadily,
&#8220;such men, when they are engaged in such
work as is going on at Carpenter&#8217;s Hall, have
many things of importance to say that they
would not say to every one; but they&#8217;d be
likely to speak to some one who is in their
confidence. Don&#8217;t you think so?&#8221;</p>

<p>A troubled look came into Nat&#8217;s face.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve thought of that,&#8221; said he. &#8220;And it&#8217;s
a real danger. But we&#8217;ll have to risk it&mdash;at
least for a little longer.&#8221;</p>

<p>That afternoon as Nat and Ben took the
road once more for Germantown&mdash;Nat with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">[151]</span>
the Porcupine perched before him in the
saddle&mdash;Ben said:</p>

<p>&#8220;I hardly think we&#8217;ll have Ezra with us
much longer.&#8221;</p>

<p>Nat looked inquiringly at his cousin; the
dwarf twisted his big head about and waited
for what was coming.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mr. Revere is going to ride back with
Congress&#8217; answer to those Suffolk resolves,&#8221;
proceeded Ben. &#8220;And Ezra will more than
likely go with him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why?&#8221; asked Nat. &#8220;I understood that
he was here as clerk to the Adamses.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;So he is. And it&#8217;s in Samuel Adams&#8217;
service he&#8217;ll go north, if he goes at all.&#8221;</p>

<p>Nat&#8217;s jaw set at this, and his brows came
together. At the same moment he felt the
Porcupine squirm; and he knew that the
same thought had come to them both.</p>

<p>&#8220;Anything of importance?&#8221; inquired Nat,
after they had ridden a little further.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know,&#8221; answered Ben. &#8220;But I
suppose so. It&#8217;s a private message, I think,
and to Dr. Warren; so I&#8217;d judge that it would
be of some consequence.&#8221;</p>

<p>Nat made no reply to this. Indeed, he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">[152]</span>
spoke but seldom all the way home. Ben
noticed it, but made no comment. However,
he thought it a little odd.</p>

<p>&#8220;But then,&#8221; he told himself, &#8220;Nat&#8217;s been
keeping to himself for a week back. Sometimes
he goes moping around thinking and
thinking like all possessed; and I&#8217;ve really
begun to wonder if he isn&#8217;t homesick for
those mountains of his, or something like
that.&#8221;</p>

<p>After supper that evening Mr. Cooper, as
was his custom, took a book and began pacing
up and down the paths at the front of the
house. He was generally left to himself on
these occasions, as it was what he called his
&#8220;study hour&#8221;; and so, when Nat came out
and quietly fell into pace beside him, he was
a little surprised.</p>

<p>&#8220;I hope I&#8217;m not disturbing you, sir,&#8221; said
the lad.</p>

<p>Mr. Cooper placed his book under his arm,
his hands behind him and smiled.</p>

<p>&#8220;Not at all,&#8221; said he.</p>

<p>The boy&#8217;s mother had been his only sister,
and a favorite with him. Nat resembled her
and this had, at first, greatly recommended<span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">[153]</span>
him to his uncle. But the quiet, strong character
of the boy had quickly made itself felt,
and Mr. Cooper, even in the short time his
nephew had been with him, had come to
value him highly.</p>

<p>And so when Nat intruded upon his study
hour he felt that there was reason for it; and
in this he was not mistaken.</p>

<p>&#8220;I wanted to speak with you alone, sir,
upon a matter of much importance,&#8221; said the
boy. &#8220;And I thought that this would be the
best time, if you don&#8217;t mind.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If it&#8217;s about the office,&#8221; said Mr. Cooper,
&#8220;don&#8217;t worry yourself. You will get down to
work in good time, never fear. We shall
probably be ready for you in a fortnight.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s not that,&#8221; answered Nat, &#8220;though I
had expected to speak to you upon the subject
at some time. This affair,&#8221; and his uncle
noticed his face grow grave, &#8220;is much more
urgent. I had thought at first to say nothing,
fancying it would untangle itself; but as the
reverse now promises to be the case, I want
your advice.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Very well,&#8221; said Mr. Cooper quietly and
attentively. He knew that the matter must<span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">[154]</span>
be of some moment, otherwise Nat would not
speak in such a fashion.</p>

<p>So with that, Nat began at the beginning
and once more told his uncle the story of his
experiences upon the night that he and the
Porcupine had ridden to the rescue of the
unsuspecting Virginians. But this time there
were no reservations of any kind. When the
name of Prentiss came into the narrative, Mr.
Cooper raised his brows, but said nothing;
however, Nat noticed that his attention grew
more marked from that moment.</p>

<p>Then came the meeting of Nat with Ezra
at the City Tavern. The similarity of the
voices impressed Mr. Cooper greatly; but
when Nat repeated Ezra&#8217;s odd words, spoken
after he learned of Nat&#8217;s acquaintance with
Mr. Washington, he uttered an exclamation.</p>

<p>&#8220;That was strangely like a veiled threat,&#8221;
said he. &#8220;And coming directly on top of
what looks like an appearance, at least, of
knowledge of the Tory plot, it sounds suspicious.
Go over that again, if you please.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He said,&#8221; obeyed Nat: &#8220;&#8216;There are certain
dispositions that take pleasure in rewarding<span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">[155]</span>
a good deed&mdash;and others that take equal
pleasure in repaying an evil one.&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If that speech were made to me,&#8221; said Mr.
Cooper, emphatically, &#8220;and under like circumstances,
I would consider that the person
making it were warning me that he&#8217;d be revenged.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I thought the same,&#8221; replied Nat, &#8220;but I
could scarcely bring myself to it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I understand. The boy is as honest looking
and as truthful appearing as any I ever
saw. But it is facts that count, and not appearances.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then Nat proceeded with Samuel Adams&#8217;
estimate of Ezra, and that of the Suffolk Convention&#8217;s
rider, Revere. As he expected, Mr.
Cooper looked puzzled. But upon hearing
the story that the Porcupine had related to
Nat, his face grew dark with anger.</p>

<p>&#8220;The young scoundrel!&#8221; he cried. &#8220;I&#8217;ll
see Mr. Adams to-morrow and&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>But Nat placed his hand upon his shoulder
and stopped him.</p>

<p>&#8220;First, let us be very&mdash;very sure,&#8221; said the
boy. &#8220;Let us make no mistake that we shall
be sorry for in the future. The whole matter<span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">[156]</span>
looks bad&mdash;I confess that I don&#8217;t see a shadow
of doubt that would make me think him other
than what you consider him. But for all that,
we had better be sure.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mr. Cooper looked at his nephew a moment.</p>

<p>&#8220;Nat,&#8221; he said, &#8220;you have a wise head.
You are right. As you say, let us be very,
very sure. In spite of everything he may be
innocent, and, in that case, if we charged him
with this shameful thing, we should indeed
have occasion for regrets. But he must be
watched&mdash;constantly watched.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But if he goes back to Boston upon this
mission of Mr. Adams?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I had forgotten that,&#8221; and Mr. Cooper grew
thoughtful. &#8220;In that case he must still be
watched; but how, is a thing that will require
some turning over.&#8221;</p>

<p>Next day Ben rode into town alone. Early
in the afternoon he returned, and his face was
alight with excitement.</p>

<p>&#8220;Father!&#8221; he cried, for Mr. Cooper was
standing in the doorway. &#8220;Ezra Prentiss is
to ride to Boston&mdash;starts to-morrow morning
with Mr. Revere, whom you&#8217;ve heard tell of.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">[157]</span>
And,&#8221; throwing himself from his mare&#8217;s
back, recklessly, &#8220;he wants me to go with
him.&#8221;</p>

<p>Nat sat upon the stone step; at these words
he turned his head and glanced up at his
uncle. Like a flash the thought traveled from
one to the other; there could be no mistake
about what was in the boy&#8217;s eyes, and Mr.
Cooper said to Ben:</p>

<p>&#8220;Very well; you may go, but not alone.
Nat must go with you.&#8221;</p>

<p>Ben shrieked with delight.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why,&#8221; cried he, &#8220;Nat&#8217;s been asked. Ezra
told me particularly to get him if I could. So
you see, you&#8217;re not saddling a caretaker on
me, after all.&#8221;</p>

<p>And as he rushed away to the barn, the
well-trained little mare at his heels, Mr.
Cooper said to Nat:</p>

<p>&#8220;Asked him particularly to get you, if
he could. What does that mean, I wonder?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know,&#8221; replied Nat, slowly,
&#8220;and I&#8217;m not going to think about it. In
the frame of mind I&#8217;m in now, I&#8217;m likely
to see evil in everything that has to do<span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">[158]</span>
with Ezra Prentiss. But I&#8217;m going back
to Boston with him, no matter what it
means. And the future will tell what it will
tell!&#8221;</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XII<br />


<small>WHAT HAPPENED ON THE NORTH ROAD</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">It</span> was high noon next day when Ezra
Prentiss slipped Mr. Adams&#8217; private despatch
to Dr. Warren into his saddle-bag. Mr. Revere
already had the resolutions passed by Congress,
and the two, together with Nat Brewster and
Ben Cooper, climbed into their saddles. Then
they waved their hands to those gathered in
front of the City Tavern to see them off.</p>

<p>&#8220;Remember what I&#8217;ve told you about my
letter and make all speed,&#8221; said Mr. Adams,
as a last word. &#8220;It is to be given to Dr.
Warren alone, as it is of great importance.&#8221;</p>

<p>This was said in a low tone as the statesman
stood at Ezra&#8217;s stirrup; but Nat Brewster, who
sat his horse next to Ezra&#8217;s, caught the words;
and likewise he heard the boy&#8217;s reply.</p>

<p>&#8220;I understand its urgency and its importance
as well,&#8221; said Ezra, gravely. &#8220;There<span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">[160]</span>
shall be no delay on the way north, and Dr.
Warren alone shall receive the message.&#8221;</p>

<p>They took their way northward at a fairly
easy pace, as Paul Revere cautioned them not
to press their horses too hard.</p>

<p>&#8220;Since I&#8217;ve taken to riding from city to
city for the various committees,&#8221; said that
gentleman, &#8220;I&#8217;ve had much experience. And
it has shown me that a soft pace in a long
journey is the swiftest in the end. Also, it
is the least laborious and anxious, for you
haven&#8217;t a broken nag to help along toward
the finish.&#8221;</p>

<p>The sun shone wonderfully and the breeze
blew in their faces with delightful freshness.
Ben Cooper longed to put Molly at her best,
for her dancing along the road showed that
her spirit was as high as his own.</p>

<p>&#8220;Where do we make the first stop?&#8221; inquired
Nat, of Revere.</p>

<p>&#8220;We should reach Bristol at sundown or
a little before,&#8221; replied the man.</p>

<p>&#8220;Bristol!&#8221; cried Ben. &#8220;Why, we could
make&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>But Revere interrupted him.</p>

<p>&#8220;I know,&#8221; said he. &#8220;So we could. And<span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">[161]</span>
we could make some other place, equally far
off, to-morrow. Then we could sit for a couple
of days at an inn and twiddle our thumbs
while the saddle-galls were healing or the
nag&#8217;s swollen legs going down.&#8221;</p>

<p>Ben felt properly rebuked; but he laughed
good humoredly.</p>

<p>&#8220;I guess you&#8217;re right,&#8221; said he. &#8220;So
you&#8217;ll have to content yourself as you are,
Molly,&#8221; to the frisky mare. &#8220;You&#8217;ve never
been on so long a journey as this; and maybe
at the end you&#8217;ll be sedate enough.&#8221;</p>

<p>As they struck into the long, dusty wagon
roads some distance north of Philadelphia,
Revere and Ezra rode on ahead. After a
time, the watchful Nat noted a marked
peculiarity in the manner of Ezra. The latter
had been very quiet and thoughtful since
leaving the city; and now there was an
anxiety in his whole attitude that could not
be mistaken. Even the unsuspecting Ben
noticed it.</p>

<p>&#8220;Wonder what&#8217;s wrong with Ezra,&#8221; he said,
with a laugh. &#8220;He keeps turning his head
from one side to the other as though it had
been shaken loose.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">[162]</span>&#8220;He is entrusted with a document of some
importance,&#8221; said Nat quietly. &#8220;Perhaps he
is a little anxious for its safety.&#8221;</p>

<p>Ben laughed once more.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, to hear you talk,&#8221; said he, &#8220;one
would think we were actually at war. Why
should he feel anxious for the safety of the
message? Who knows anything of it but us?
And then,&#8221; gaily, &#8220;if he thought this was a
bad way to come, why did he argue with Mr.
Revere, who wanted to come by another
way?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah,&#8221; said Nat, thoughtfully, &#8220;did he do
that?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;For half an hour. And do you know, he
grew actually warm about it, just as though it
greatly mattered.&#8221;</p>

<p>There was silence for a little while, and
then Ben suddenly exclaimed:</p>

<p>&#8220;Hello! What&#8217;s that for?&#8221;</p>

<p>Nat had unbuckled the flap of a holster
and loosened the heavy pistol which had been
so lately the property of Mr. Chew.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s my backwoods nature, I suppose,&#8221;
said Nat, carelessly. &#8220;Up in Wyoming the
wild things and the Indians never allow us to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">[163]</span>
travel without firearms ready to hand, and I
don&#8217;t feel quite comfortable otherwise.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I should think that long rifle would be
enough to take with you through a settled
country,&#8221; said Ben, nodding toward the
weapon which his cousin carried slung across
his shoulders.</p>

<p>&#8220;It would be ordinarily. But it is not
quite handy enough on horseback.&#8221;</p>

<p>Ben looked at the speaker with his usual
good-natured grin.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, all I can say,&#8221; remarked he, &#8220;is
that it must be in the air. If Mr. Revere begins
to take notions about things also, why,
I&#8217;ll have to take general charge of the party,
that&#8217;s all.&#8221;</p>

<p>When the shadows began to lengthen by
the roadside and thicken among the clumps
of trees and tall brush, they were still some
miles south of Bristol. The Delaware rippled
smoothly on the right, and here and there the
filled sail of a sloop could be seen as it made
its way up river with wind and tide.</p>

<p>&#8220;What building is that ahead?&#8221; asked Nat,
after a time.</p>

<p>They had rounded a bend in the road, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">[164]</span>
a stone structure, smoke-begrimed and forlorn
looking, showed itself blackly against the
sky-line.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know,&#8221; replied Ben. &#8220;I&#8217;ve never
traveled this route before. But it looks like
a burned mill or something of the sort.&#8221;</p>

<p>There are things and there are persons
whom one naturally suspects; there may be
no reason for it that one can see, but still the
suspicion grows stronger and stronger; and
often it turns out that there is cause for it.
When they came in sight of the ruined mill,
frowning gloomily out upon the road, Nat
Brewster felt just such a suspicion growing in
his mind. More than once, among his native
hills in the north, he had run upon an ambuscade&mdash;a
crouching panther perhaps; and once
a murderous red man. And so it was a kind
of second nature to him to regard suspicious
places with caution and to advance upon them
with his eyes wide open.</p>

<p>Accordingly, as they rode toward the
burned building, he eyed it narrowly; when
they were within fifty yards of it his vigilance
was rewarded, for he caught sight of a man&#8217;s
head cautiously lifted above the edge of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">[165]</span>
one of the openings that were once windows.</p>

<p>Instantly the boy struck his spurs into the
tall black; the animal, startled, fought for its
head, and finding that the strong hand upon
the rein did not give an inch, it raced forward.
A score of bounds brought it alongside
of Ezra and Mr. Revere, and they, surprised
at the sudden burst of speed, were turning
their heads, when:</p>

<p>&#8220;Halt!&#8221; said Nat, sharply.</p>

<p>With astonishment written large upon his
face, Revere obeyed, and Ezra did the same.</p>

<p>&#8220;What is it?&#8221; asked the rider from Boston.
&#8220;Has anything gone wrong?&#8221;</p>

<p>Nat drew his pistol from the holster and
coolly examined the priming.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know,&#8221; replied he. &#8220;But it&#8217;s
rather likely. Just ahead there is a person&mdash;perhaps
several of them&mdash;who seems interested
in us, in a cautious sort of way.&#8221;</p>

<p>As he spoke his keen eyes went to the face
of Ezra; he saw it pale and the mouth twitch.</p>

<p>&#8220;It would be best,&#8221; proceeded Nat, evenly,
&#8220;for you all to remain as you are. I&#8217;ll ride
forward and look into matters a trifle.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">[166]</span>He was about to do so, but upon second
thought checked his horse.</p>

<p>&#8220;Are you armed, Mr. Revere?&#8221; he inquired.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am,&#8221; answered the rider, promptly, and
out came a squat, serviceable looking pistol.</p>

<p>&#8220;Good,&#8221; said Nat. Then he took the rifle
from about his shoulders and threw it to Ben,
who had ridden up and sat listening in silent
amazement. &#8220;It&#8217;s loaded and ready,&#8221; proceeded
the young mountaineer, &#8220;and it shoots
straight, as you know. Cover my advance.&#8221;</p>

<p>With that he spoke to the black; the
animal trotted forward; and when it reached
the ruin, Nat drew it in and turned, facing
the structure from the middle of the road.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hello!&#8221; cried the boy. &#8220;Hello, inside
there!&#8221;</p>

<p>He waited, but there was no answer.</p>

<p>Then he tried again.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hello! Don&#8217;t think that your keeping
silent will deceive me. I know you&#8217;re there.&#8221;</p>

<p>Still there was no answer. Down the road,
Nat saw his three companions, their horses
abreast, anxiously watching him. He smiled
when he saw the alert posture of Ben, the
long rifle in his hands, for Nat knew that his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">[167]</span>
cousin shot with unerring skill, and that he
could rest safe under the protection thus afforded.
Once more he turned his gaze upon
the ruin.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll give you a minute,&#8221; continued he.
&#8220;If you&#8217;re not out in that time, I&#8217;m coming
in.&#8221;</p>

<p>This had immediate results. In the broken
doorway of the burned mill appeared a half
dozen men; and behind them Nat made out
a burly figure which he at once recognized as
that of Royce.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; inquired one of the men, sullenly,
&#8220;what do you want?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I want to have nothing to say to you, sir,
at all events,&#8221; replied Nat, readily. Then lifting
his voice a trifle, he continued: &#8220;Stand
forward, Mr. Royce. Don&#8217;t be backward.&#8221;</p>

<p>The man at once pushed his way to the
front. His coarse, large-featured face was inflamed
and angry looking.</p>

<p>&#8220;So it&#8217;s you, is it?&#8221; growled he, his fierce
eyes glowering wickedly. &#8220;I thought I recognized
your voice.&#8221;</p>

<p>Nat laughed.</p>

<p>&#8220;And I rather thought I recognized your<span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">[168]</span>
face as you took that little observation from
the window a few moments ago.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, what do you want?&#8221; asked Royce.
&#8220;We can&#8217;t be detained here all day by a whipper-snapper
like you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I wouldn&#8217;t think of detaining you,&#8221; replied
Nat. &#8220;I merely desired to make sure
that I and my friends met with no reception
that we were not prepared for.&#8221;</p>

<p>As he spoke he lifted his hand and beckoned
his comrades forward. As they came
up at a trot, Revere and Ben holding their
weapons ready, Nat said to them:</p>

<p>&#8220;I think you&#8217;d better ride on while I stay
for a little further talk with these gentlemen.
Ben, you may halt fifty yards away.&#8221;</p>

<p>There was that in the speaker&#8217;s manner
that showed Revere that he was perfectly
competent to carry out any plan that he had
made. And so the convention&#8217;s messenger
nodded his head and rode along up the road
with the two boys.</p>

<p>Nat Brewster would have given a great deal
to have seen Ezra Prentiss&#8217; face at that moment.
But he dared not take his eyes from
the sullen, muttering group in the doorway of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">[169]</span>
the mill. He smiled as he heard the hoofs of
his companions&#8217; horses rattling away. To
Royce he said:</p>

<p>&#8220;It seems, Mr. Royce, that our arrangements
clash now and then.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; replied the man, loweringly, &#8220;and
take care that it does not happen once too
often.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I think the care should be upon your
part, if you value yourself at all,&#8221; said Nat.
&#8220;If I had spread the news abroad of your attempt
of a week ago, the people of Philadelphia
would have torn you apart.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If they had caught me,&#8221; sneered the man.</p>

<p>&#8220;At least they would have caught Mr.
Dimisdale and a few others. And I have no
doubt that you, also, could have been taken,
had enough people been so minded. There is
too much bitterness in the public mind to
tolerate such plots as you are engaged in.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You seem to know a great deal,&#8221; said
Royce.</p>

<p>&#8220;Much more, perhaps, than you even
think,&#8221; returned Nat. &#8220;But I&#8217;ll not put you
to the trouble of listening to it all: I&#8217;ll just
say that any message intended for a good<span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">[170]</span>
patriot is going to reach him. Make no mistake
about that.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then, as the rage of Royce grew greater
and a look of astonishment went around the
others, Nat continued:</p>

<p>&#8220;Now I&#8217;ll bid you good-evening. But first
I&#8217;ll ask you,&#8221; and he never took his eyes from
them, &#8220;to look up the road. There, I have
no doubt, you will see a lad with a rifle.&#8221;</p>

<p>The followers of Royce and Royce himself
gazed up the road as directed; and from their
expressions Nat gathered that Ben was waiting
there with the long weapon ready.</p>

<p>&#8220;He,&#8221; continued the young mountaineer,
&#8220;is going, so to speak, to cover my retreat.
And as I&#8217;ve never known him to miss a shot,
I warn you to be very careful what you do.&#8221;</p>

<p>And with that he turned his back fearlessly
upon them, gave rein to his horse and rode
toward Ben, who was dismounted and planted
in the roadway, the rifle at his shoulder.</p>

<p>When his cousin came up, young Cooper
said:</p>

<p>&#8220;I say, now, what is all this about?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ll know in good time,&#8221; replied Nat.
Molly stood grazing at the roadside; he took<span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">[171]</span>
her rein and continued: &#8220;I&#8217;ll take the mare
with me. You come along with your face to
them until we get out of pistol shot. They
haven&#8217;t any heavier arms that I could see.&#8221;</p>

<p>Ben followed these orders carefully. When
they had moved out of range of any stray
shot, he remounted and slung the rifle before
him, a complaint plain upon his face.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll know in good time, will I?&#8221; said he,
in an injured tone. &#8220;Now, I want you to
understand, Nat Brewster, that I&#8217;m not to be
treated as a child. If I&#8217;m old enough to keep
these men from shooting you in the back, I&#8217;m
also old enough to be told who they are and
what they were after.&#8221;</p>

<p>Nat laughed.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why,&#8221; said he, &#8220;that sounds like good
sense. And I suppose I&#8217;ll have to tell you.
But, remember,&#8221; warningly, &#8220;it goes no
farther.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;All right,&#8221; spoke Ben, &#8220;I promise.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;They are the same men that I met at the
inn on the ferry road,&#8221; Nat told him. &#8220;And,
while I&#8217;m not sure, I think they were waiting
for Ezra.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;For Ezra!&#8221; Ben stared, open-eyed.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">[172]</span>&#8220;To relieve him of the message he&#8217;s carrying
to Dr. Warren.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I see,&#8221; said Ben, soberly. Then they rode
forward in silence until they overtook their
companions.</p>

<p>&#8220;The ruffians,&#8221; exclaimed Revere, warmly.
&#8220;I had not thought that thieves were so bold
in these parts.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Common thieves are not, I suppose,&#8221; said
Nat, quietly.</p>

<p>Revere continued to fume and mutter as they
rode along toward Bristol, the housetops of
which were gradually coming into view.
Ben was now riding with him and Ezra had
fallen back until his mount was abreast of
Nat&#8217;s.</p>

<p>&#8220;You think, then,&#8221; said Ezra, and his tone
was low, &#8220;that those men were not common
thieves.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I do,&#8221; replied Nat. &#8220;A man&#8217;s purse
would be safe with them, I feel sure. Something
of greater value was in their minds, I
feel sure.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;So do I,&#8221; replied Ezra. He looked at Nat
steadily for a moment and then said with a
faint smile, &#8220;You&#8217;ve met those men before?&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">[173]</span>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; quietly.</p>

<p>&#8220;I felt sure that you had. And do you recall
some words which I spoke after you told
me of that meeting?&#8221;</p>

<p>The words that had struck both himself
and his uncle as veiling a threat at once recurred
to him.</p>

<p>&#8220;You mean,&#8221; said Nat, &#8220;those regarding
the disposition of some to reward a good service,
and of others to repay an evil?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I see you remember it,&#8221; said Ezra, and he
smiled into Nat&#8217;s face. &#8220;So I need not repeat
it now.&#8221;</p>

<small>SHOWS HOW NAT MET ONE STRANGER AND HOW<br />
THE PORCUPINE MET ANOTHER</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Bristol</span> was a fair-sized village upon the
west bank of the Delaware, and one very
well known to persons upon their way to and
from New York. Consequently there was a
good inn and our wayfarers at once sought
it out.</p>

<p>&#8220;When I stopped here on my way south,&#8221;
said Revere, seriously, to a hostler who came
forward to receive their mounts, &#8220;you did
not give my horse proper attention as I desired.
It will not do to rub him down with a
wisp of straw and rush him in, still wet, to
a sloppy supper of bran mash.&#8221;</p>

<p>The hostler protested, but Revere waved his
hand for silence.</p>

<p>&#8220;I want him brushed and combed, and
rubbed with a cloth,&#8221; proceeded he, severely.
&#8220;And these others,&#8221; pointing to the steeds of
the boys, &#8220;are to be used likewise. Then<span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">[175]</span>
they are to be blanketed until they are dry
and cool, when they should be fed&mdash;not with
mash, but with grain.&#8221;</p>

<p>The groom promised faithfully to do as he
was bidden; but it was not until he had carefully
repeated his instructions several times
more that Revere was satisfied and consented
to enter the inn.</p>

<p>&#8220;The beasts can&#8217;t speak for themselves, or
do for themselves,&#8221; said he. &#8220;So it is our duty
to see that right is done by them.&#8221;</p>

<p>The inn was a cheerful place, with many
brass candlesticks and painted china plates;
and the landlady was a good-natured, rosy
dame, who bustled about making them comfortable.</p>

<p>&#8220;I shall get you a good supper,&#8221; she told
them, &#8220;for I&#8217;m quite sure that you&#8217;ll need it
after being so many hours upon the road.
And there&#8217;s warm water and basins and
towels and soap in the little room close by
the kitchen. So you can make yourselves
clean and fresh while you are waiting to be
served.&#8221;</p>

<p>They thanked her for this and made good
use of the articles named. Nat was the first<span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">[176]</span>
to finish, and as he stepped back into the inn
parlor he noticed that a newcomer had taken
possession of a big chair at the window overlooking
the road, and was calmly reciting his
desires to the obliging hostess.</p>

<p>&#8220;I shall want some boiled mutton,&#8221; said
he, &#8220;with a savory sauce. And pay heed to
the sauce, madam; let it not be the flavorless
thing one gets at so many inns. The meat
served may be ever so good, but if the sauce
has a breath too much garlic it is all ruined.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, sir; it shall be just as you like it, I
assure you,&#8221; said the landlady, dropping the
stranger a curtsey. &#8220;And will there be anything
else, sir?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Some potatoes&mdash;baked in their jackets&mdash;a
small loaf and some mead&mdash;if you have any
that&#8217;s fit for a gentleman to drink.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s none better, sir, in this section,&#8221;
said the good dame, rather nettled. &#8220;And I
might even say that you&#8217;d hardly find better
in your own country.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;My own country!&#8221; repeated the stranger,
and he looked at her keenly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, sir,&mdash;England. For you are an
Englishman, unless your tongue belies you.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">[177]</span>The man laughed and waved his hand.</p>

<p>&#8220;That will be all, I think,&#8221; said he. &#8220;So
make haste and don&#8217;t stand making hazards
at the private affairs of your guests.&#8221;</p>

<p>Indignantly the hostess turned away.</p>

<p>&#8220;Such high and mighty ways,&#8221; she muttered
to Nat. &#8220;It&#8217;ll be a blessing if he has
enough money in his purse to settle his score
in the morning.&#8221;</p>

<p>And with this she went angrily into her
kitchen, slamming the door, leaving Nat
to seat himself upon a settle along the
wall and amuse himself by studying the
stranger.</p>

<p>The latter was a tall man with a high,
prominent nose and a wide, thin-lipped
mouth. His hair was very long and worn in
a queue, and his black-stockinged legs were
thrown carelessly over the arm of his chair in
an unsightly, lounging way that gave him
the appearance of great awkwardness. There
was still considerable daylight, and he read a
newspaper which he took from his pocket as
soon as the landlady had departed.</p>

<p>&#8220;And the newspaper has something in it
which amuses him greatly,&#8221; thought Nat, as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">[178]</span>
he watched the humorous twitching of the
thin-lipped mouth.</p>

<p>Wider and wider grew the smile and at last
the man threw the news sheet from him with
a roar of glee.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now out upon them for a parcel of raving
maniacs,&#8221; said he. &#8220;Did ever any one hear
of such folly before since the world began?&#8221;</p>

<p>As he laughed his eyes rested upon Nat,
and, apparently for the first time, he became
aware of the boy&#8217;s presence. The eyes were
light colored, cold and keen, as the lad saw
when they became steadfastly fixed upon him;
and that they were also cruel, he was firmly
convinced.</p>

<p>&#8220;Young gentleman,&#8221; said the man, growing
sober enough, &#8220;good-evening.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Good-evening, sir,&#8221; returned Nat, politely.</p>

<p>There was a long row of brass buttons down
the front of the man&#8217;s coat; he took the one
at the top between a thumb and forefinger in
a speculative sort of way; then the touch
dropped to the second button and so on down
the row until he reached the bottom. And
all the time the cold, light-colored eyes were
fixed upon the lad from the north country;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">[179]</span>
and they were studying and weighing and
estimating him steadily. Finally, so it
seemed, the stranger made up his mind. He
removed his legs from the chair arm and
stretched them out before him; the waning
sunlight played upon the big brass buckles
upon his shoes as he turned his feet first one
way and then the other, inspecting them
thoughtfully.</p>

<p>&#8220;It will be a fine evening,&#8221; ventured he, at
last.</p>

<p>&#8220;So I&#8217;ve thought myself,&#8221; returned Nat.</p>

<p>&#8220;And following a fine day,&#8221; said the
man.</p>

<p>Nat nodded. He was disappointed. Evidently
the stranger was not nearly so interesting
as he looked.</p>

<p>&#8220;Travel far?&#8221; asked the man, after another
pause, but not so long as the first.</p>

<p>&#8220;Not a great way.&#8221;</p>

<p>The stranger pursed up his thin lips and
looked at the boy carefully. Seemingly he
made up his mind that he might venture the
question, for he asked:</p>

<p>&#8220;From the city?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; was the brief answer.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">[180]</span>That there might be no mistake the man
persisted:</p>

<p>&#8220;Philadelphia?&#8221;</p>

<p>Nat nodded. Clearly the stranger was
nothing short of a bore.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve just ridden from there myself,&#8221; said
the lean stranger. &#8220;There is much excitement
there, eh?&#8221;</p>

<p>Nat nodded.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve seen places where there was a great
deal more demonstration, so to speak,&#8221;
went on the man, &#8220;but for genuine interest,
felt of the heart, that city is ahead of them
all.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve thought that it seemed impressed
with the importance of the occasion,&#8221; said
Nat. &#8220;But that is scarcely to be wondered
at.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It is not, indeed,&#8221; agreed the man, readily.
&#8220;It would, in fact, be cause for great wonder
if the town and its people were not impressed.&#8221;
He leaned toward the boy in a grave sort of
way and continued: &#8220;Modern history does
not show anything that can compare with the
events which have happened of late in these
colonies; and those which are on their way to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">[181]</span>
happen will be greater still. We shall show
a stubborn and narrow ministry that we are
determined to be justly dealt by.&#8221;</p>

<p>Nat looked at the speaker with attention.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you know,&#8221; said he, &#8220;I&#8217;m just a little
surprised to hear you speak after this fashion?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why?&#8221; asked the stranger, and the cold,
light-colored eyes peered through their wrinkled
lids.</p>

<p>&#8220;Because, as our landlady said a short
while since, you are an Englishman, or your
accent greatly misrepresents you.&#8221;</p>

<p>A shade of annoyance crossed the stranger&#8217;s
face; Nat, ever watchful, saw his hands clinch
upon the arm&#8217;s of his chair. But this only
lasted for a moment; the lean countenance
cleared up, the hands relaxed their grip and
the man lay back in his chair, smiling
amusedly.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is an odd thing,&#8221; spoke he, &#8220;that the
fact of my being English has been so noted of
late. No sooner do I open my mouth than I
am looked at askance; if I utter a sentiment
in favor of liberty, I am stared at in amaze;
if I condemn tyranny, as every honest man
should, my hearers regard me with wonder.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">[182]</span>He paused and watched Nat, the smile of
amusement still wrinkling the corners of his
mouth. Then he leaned forward, as before,
proceeding:</p>

<p>&#8220;But I can tell you the reason of this. It
is because the country is young. It is inexperienced.
It is not yet mature enough to
know that a man may be a friend to freedom
no matter where he was born. Don&#8217;t forget,
young gentleman, that true liberty began in
England, and that it still has its lovers and
upholders there.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why,&#8221; said Nat, &#8220;I have no doubt but
that there is a great deal of truth in what you
say.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It is all truth,&#8221; stated the stranger positively.
&#8220;The fact is recognized by the leading
spirits in this movement, at least. And if
the time ever comes, and I sincerely hope it
shall not, that blows be struck in this land,
there shall be no lack of men of English birth
in the colonial army.&#8221;</p>

<p>The man then proceeded to enlarge upon
his theme and to point out to Nat that the
great mass of the British population sympathized
with the colonists, that it was only certain<span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">[183]</span>
merchants and ministers who, it seemed,
had combined to oppress them. He was still
so engaged when the landlady appeared in
the kitchen door.</p>

<p>&#8220;Sir,&#8221; she announced, addressing the Englishman,
&#8220;I would be much beholden to you
if you would step in here and look to your
dishes before they are made ready. I am not
honored by so particular a person every day,
and would wish to be sure that my poor skill
as a cook has not led me wrong.&#8221;</p>

<p>With a laugh the stranger arose, and Nat
saw that he was of remarkable height and
had wide, strong shoulders. And, while the
young mountaineer had had little opportunity
to observe the habits of military men,
he at once put him down as a soldier.</p>

<p>&#8220;He has the bearing that I would think a
trained officer would have,&#8221; was the lad&#8217;s instant
thought.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ll pardon me, I know,&#8221; said the
stranger. &#8220;The art of dining well is a very
important one, as you&#8217;ll learn by the time you
reach my age: so I must not miss this opportunity.&#8221;</p>

<p>After the speaker had followed the hostess<span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">[184]</span>
into the kitchen, Nat sat upon the bench and
cogitated.</p>

<p>&#8220;There is something queer about him, for
all he&#8217;s so well spoken,&#8221; was the lad&#8217;s judgment.
&#8220;I hardly think I should like to
have much dealing with him.&#8221;</p>

<p>He patiently awaited his three companions;
but as they seemed in no hurry to join him he
bent over and picked up the newspaper which
the Englishman had so contemptuously
thrown aside.</p>

<p>As it happened, it was folded just as the
man had been reading it, and Nat saw at once
that it was a detailed account of the proceedings
of Congress that must have excited the
reader&#8217;s derision. Nat put down the sheet,
and an expression of understanding crossed
his face.</p>

<p>&#8220;Lucky I saw that,&#8221; said he. &#8220;The
man&#8217;s quality is plain enough now, and I&#8217;ll
know how to use him from now on.&#8221;</p>

<p>A little later at the sound of high voices
he went to a window overlooking the inn
yard. Paul Revere was there, as was also
Ezra and Ben, and the former was lecturing
the grooms for some shortcoming in their<span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">[185]</span>
care of the horses. Nat looked and listened,
greatly amused at the earnestness of the man
from Boston, and as he did so, he indistinctly
saw, out of the tail of his eye, a small figure
under the brick arch that opened into the
yard. Swiftly turning his head in that
direction he was surprised and astonished to
recognize the form of the Porcupine.</p>

<p>That the dwarf saw Nat at the window was
at once evident; for he lifted one hand in a
quick beckoning movement and gave a flirt
of his hand toward the front of the inn. Nat
nodded; he turned, walked to the main door
and out upon the porch. Across the road
was a tall elm tree; the Porcupine now stood
near this, but in such a position as not to be
readily seen by any one looking from the
windows of the inn.</p>

<p>Nat crossed to the elm in a state of amazement.</p>

<p>&#8220;Porcupine,&#8221; began he at once, &#8220;you are
the most astonishing little animal I ever saw.
How did you ever get so far from home?&#8221;</p>

<p>The dwarf grinned.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, this isn&#8217;t so far,&#8221; replied he. &#8220;I&#8217;ve
often been here with Simon Nichols, the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">[186]</span>
kitchen gardener. You see, he has a sloop
and takes it to the city every second day, in
the season, with fresh green things. When I
heard that you were going off to Boston, I
knew you&#8217;d stop here overnight; so I
boarded Simon&#8217;s sloop yesterday in Dock
Creek and got here about noon to-day. He&#8217;s
always glad to have me because I can help
work ship and do lots of things when he&#8217;s
short handed, as he &#8217;most always is.&#8221;</p>

<p>Nat laughed heartily; and yet he was
touched.</p>

<p>&#8220;And you put yourself to all this bother
just to see me off, did you?&#8221; he asked; and
the other nodded. &#8220;Well, you&#8217;re a queer
little fellow, aren&#8217;t you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;So I&#8217;ve been told before,&#8221; grinned the
Porcupine. &#8220;But,&#8221; more soberly, &#8220;there are
some just as queer, and at no great distance
from here, either.&#8221;</p>

<p>The tone in which these words were spoken
attracted Nat&#8217;s attention at once. He had
known the dwarf but a short time, but he
had come to understand that when he
spoke in a certain way he was very much in
earnest.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">[187]</span>&#8220;Has anything happened?&#8221; asked the lad
from the north.</p>

<p>The other shook his head dubiously.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know,&#8221; answered he. &#8220;But I
should say something is going to, unless the
signs are all wrong.&#8221;</p>

<p>Nat looked at the speaker attentively; but
as usual he did not try to hurry him.</p>

<p>&#8220;As this is the inn where I felt sure you&#8217;d
stay for the night,&#8221; proceeded the Porcupine,
&#8220;I came here as soon as Simon had tied up
the sloop at his place about a mile above.
The landlady is a good sort, for when she saw
me standing about the door, she gave me
some bread and cheese, and I came over here
in the shade to eat it. And while I sat here,
a man came up&mdash;a strange-appearing man
with gold rings in his ears and the look of a
gypsy.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Good afternoon,&#8217; he says as he gets sight
of me.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">[188]</span>&#8220;I, politely enough, bid him the time of
day and fell to studying him as he stood
there looking up at the inn. He carried a
heavy staff and pack upon his back. As he
came along, I had noticed that he limped like
one footsore from a long journey; but for all,
he seemed cool and clean. There was but
little dust upon his shoes and none at all
upon his stockings.&#8221;</p>


<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i_188.jpg" alt="" /></div>
<p class="drop-cap"><i>&#8220;THERE IS SOMETHING WRONG,
THEN&#8221;</i></p>

<p>&#8220;You have excellent observation, Porcupine,&#8221;
praised Nat.</p>

<p>&#8220;It does not do to keep one&#8217;s eyes shut in
such times as these,&#8221; answered the dwarf,
wisely. &#8220;And, again, I shouldn&#8217;t get any
credit for it, because I was just idling away
the time until you rode up and had no notion
of anything being wrong.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah,&#8221; said Nat, with increased interest,
&#8220;there is something wrong then?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Again I must say that I don&#8217;t know,&#8221;
and the speaker shook his head. &#8220;It only
seemed queer to me; and what followed
looked a great deal more so. But sit down
here,&#8221; added the dwarf, indicating a place
where some bushes would screen Nat from
the inn windows. &#8220;It would be just as well,
maybe, if you were not seen talking to me.&#8221;</p>

<p>Nat did as directed; then the speaker once
more took up his story:</p>

<p>&#8220;After a few moments the gypsy-looking
man walked over, threw off his pack, sat<span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">[189]</span>
down and began to fan himself with his hat.
Then I saw that he was tattooed upon the
back of his hands, and looking carefully I saw
that on one was a ship and on the other the
Union Jack.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Do you belong hereabouts?&#8217; says he.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Not very far away,&#8217; I answers him.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;I&#8217;ve come a long distance,&#8217; says he, &#8216;to
meet some friends. Has any one gone into
the inn lately?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;The landlady,&#8217; I told him.</p>

<p>&#8220;And with that,&#8221; continued the Porcupine,
&#8220;I could see that he began to think me a
great deal of a fool. He was not so careful
thereafter.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;If you&#8217;ll go into the inn yard and see
what horses are there, freshly come in, I&#8217;ll
give you a shilling,&#8217; he says.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Very well,&#8217; says I; and I was about to
start across the road; but he stopped me.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Especially mark,&#8217; says he, &#8216;if there is a
fine looking bay horse, a small mare, a wicked
looking raw-boned black and a buckskin stallion.&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Our horses!&#8221; ejaculated Nat, &#8220;and described
as well as I could describe them myself.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">[190]</span>&#8220;I found that out afterward,&#8221; said the
Porcupine, &#8220;though if I&#8217;d thought, I&#8217;d have
recognized your nag and Ben Cooper&#8217;s, even
then. But anyhow, I went into the yard and
looked about, also into the barn; but there
was none but old work horses, and so I told
the man with the rings in his ears when I
came out. He didn&#8217;t appear to relish it very
well and muttered and went on at a great
rate. Then something seemed to strike him.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Is there another inn in Bristol?&#8217; asked
he.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;There is,&#8217; I told him. And I was just
giving him the directions when we heard the
clatter of hoofs, and along you came with
your friends. I stopped until you had all
gone into the yard; and when I turned my
head once more, the man was running down
the road in the direction from which he had
come.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But,&#8221; questioned Nat, &#8220;why did you not
come in and tell me all this at once?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Because I felt sure there was to be more
come of it. And I was right. The foreign-looking
man had gone no great distance when
a second one rode into the path and stopped<span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">[191]</span>
him short. They talked together for a little
while and then the first man disappeared in
a thicket, while the second came on quietly
enough and entered the inn.&#8221;</p>

<p>Nat nodded.</p>

<p>&#8220;He was a tall man, lean and with a large,
thin nose, was he not?&#8221; came the question.</p>

<p>&#8220;I looked through the window and saw
you talking to him a while ago,&#8221; answered
the dwarf. &#8220;I suppose, though,&#8221; with a grin,
&#8220;he didn&#8217;t tell you what he wanted.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Hardly,&#8221; said Nat, &#8220;for from what you
have seen, it would scarcely bear telling.&#8221;</p>

<p>They were silent for a moment, and then
the boy from Wyoming resumed:</p>

<p>&#8220;The day has not been without its interest;
and from the look of things, the night is promising
to keep pace with it.&#8221;</p>

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_192">[192]</span>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XIV<br />


<small>THE NIGHT PROMISES WELL</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Nat Brewster</span> left the Porcupine under the
big elm across from the Bristol inn.</p>

<p>&#8220;Say nothing to any one,&#8221; he warned him.
&#8220;I&#8217;ll have the landlady get you a supper and
make you up a bed somewhere where you&#8217;ll
not be noticed. Remember, I don&#8217;t even
want Ben to see you.&#8221;</p>

<p>He crossed the road and entered the inn in
deep thought. The mission of the two
strangers greatly troubled him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course,&#8221; he told himself, &#8220;it&#8217;s connected
with the message that Ezra carries to
Dr. Warren. But who are these men? They
do not belong to the party we encountered at
the burned mill, I feel sure; for they go about
their work in a more crafty and experienced
manner.&#8221;</p>

<p>Of course, under the circumstances, to show
Ezra that he knew anything about them was
out of the question.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_193">[193]</span>&#8220;And I can&#8217;t tell Mr. Revere or Ben anything
either,&#8221; he reasoned, &#8220;for as soon
as I had done so they would let it all out to
Ezra. And, if there is any truth in my
suspicions that the strangers are friends of his,
he&#8217;d warn them at once, a thing that I most
particularly don&#8217;t want done.&#8221;</p>

<p>In a very little while the candles were
lighted and the tables spread with smoking
dishes. In the meantime Nat had spoken
quietly to the landlady, and the good soul had
at once fallen in with his plans of feeding and
housing the dwarf.</p>

<p>&#8220;But I quite agree with what you say,
young gentleman, in regard to not allowing
my other guests to know of his presence.
They might object to having such an unfortunate
in the house. Travelers, you know,
are most peculiar.&#8221;</p>

<p>And so Nat had the satisfaction, when he
sat down to his supper, of knowing that his
little friend was also well taken care of,
and in a position, perhaps, to render a
prompt service, if such a thing should be
necessary.</p>

<p>Revere, Ezra, Ben Cooper and Nat were gathered<span class="pagenum" id="Page_194">[194]</span>
about a large table; a smaller one was
laid for the tall Englishman, and he smiled
contentedly as he tucked the generous napkin
under his chin.</p>

<p>&#8220;Madam,&#8221; said he, to the landlady, &#8220;I
take this occasion to ask your pardon. I did
you the discredit of questioning your skill in
cookery; but in the presence of these gentlemen
I take it back unreservedly.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But you have not tasted the dishes as
yet,&#8221; protested the landlady, assuming to be
short and vexed. But in reality she was
much mollified.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t need to taste them to be assured of
their excellence,&#8221; spoke the stranger with a
wave of the hand. &#8220;The aroma that arises
as I lift each separate cover is enough for me.
You are not a cook, madam; you are an
artist.&#8221;</p>

<p>And so with great good humor he fell to
and proved to be a worthy trencherman.
Revere, eating generously of his own supper,
watched their neighbor in high admiration.
At length he said:</p>

<p>&#8220;It is not at every inn one finds such excellent
fare, sir.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">[195]</span>&#8220;Right!&#8221; and the stranger saluted him
with his knife. &#8220;Right, sir. And that is
why I was suspicious at the off-start. But,&#8221;
and he bowed to the now gratified hostess
with great politeness, &#8220;I shall always remember
the town of Bristol. I shall write the
name large in the records of my experiences,
because it is a place that possesses an inn
where a gentleman can dine.&#8221;</p>

<p>As he was speaking the door opened and a
newcomer made his appearance. At sight
of the small gold rings in his ears, the pack
upon his back and the heavy oaken staff in
his hand, Nat Brewster recognized him as the
stranger to whom the Porcupine had talked
on the road. He was a swarthy looking fellow
and decidedly like a gypsy, as the dwarf
had said; but there was a roll to his gait and
an air about him that would have told an experienced
observer that he was no stranger to
the sea.</p>

<p>&#8220;I would like accommodations, madam,&#8221;
said he to the landlady, and there was a foreign
blur of some sort that spoiled the distinctness
of his speech.</p>

<p>&#8220;Supper, a bed and breakfast, I suppose,&#8221;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_196">[196]</span>
said the woman, very brisk and businesslike.
Foot travelers were never very profitable as a
rule, and she did not waste much time upon
them.</p>

<p>&#8220;If you please,&#8221; said the dark man. He
threw down his knapsack and stood the staff
in a corner. &#8220;And as I am hungry I should
like my supper as soon as you can give it to
me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I shall have to lay another cloth,&#8221; said
the landlady, with the air of one who does
not altogether like a task. &#8220;I would that
you had come sooner, sir.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am sorry to be troublesome,&#8221; said the
other, civilly enough; but for all, Nat saw a
look in his piercing black eyes that gave the
lie to his words.</p>

<p>The tall stranger had been quietly listening
to this dialogue with a careless air. But now
he arose.</p>

<p>&#8220;Madam,&#8221; said he, politely, to the hostess,
&#8220;to save you trouble and offer the hand of
good fellowship to a stranger and a wayfarer,&#8221;
bowing to the swarthy man, &#8220;let me say that
the other side of my table is at the gentleman&#8217;s
service.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">[197]</span>&#8220;Why,&#8221; said the pleased landlady, &#8220;that is
very kind of you.&#8221;</p>

<p>The sailor-like man looked properly grateful.</p>

<p>&#8220;I thank you, sir,&#8221; said he. &#8220;I did not expect
such civil treatment from one whom I
never saw before.&#8221;</p>

<p>As the newcomer settled himself into a
chair facing the other, Ben, who sat beside
Nat, whispered to him, lowly:</p>

<p>&#8220;I wouldn&#8217;t have expected it of him at any
rate. But he must be a far better natured
man than I&#8217;d put him down to be.&#8221;</p>

<p>However, Nat only smiled. The play between
the two men, who were greeting each
other as strangers, interested and amused him.</p>

<p>&#8220;And they do it very well, too,&#8221; he thought,
sadly neglecting his food that he might miss
nothing of what was going forward. &#8220;If I
did not know what the Porcupine told me I&#8217;d
be deceived as well as the most innocent of
them.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It is a wearying and sultry time of the
year to tramp the roads,&#8221; said the tall man to
the newcomer, sympathizingly. &#8220;I hope you
have not far to go.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">[198]</span>&#8220;To Trenton,&#8221; responded the swarthy man.
&#8220;And it&#8217;s a long journey enough when you
consider that I&#8217;ve come from New Castle in
Delaware.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Is it so, indeed? And bearing that pack
upon your shoulders, too.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s not so comfortable as it might be,&#8221;
laughed the other shortly; &#8220;and not so lightly
carried as your saddle-bags, which I see hanging
upon the wall.&#8221;</p>

<p>The tall man turned and looked where the
other pointed.</p>

<p>&#8220;It just happens that I&#8217;m not sure that those
are mine,&#8221; said he. Then running his eye
over the array of hats, saddle-bags and riding-whips
which hung upon the wooden pegs, he
remarked, addressing those at the other table:
&#8220;Did it ever occur to you, gentlemen, how
alike all such things are? For the life of me
I can&#8217;t see why we are not continually mistaking
each other&#8217;s property.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Now that I think of it,&#8221; spoke Mr. Revere,
&#8220;I must say that I agree with you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I knew you would,&#8221; said the tall man.
Then with a laugh he added, lightly: &#8220;But
let us put it to the test.&#8221; He looked at the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">[199]</span>
things upon the wall as though reckoning
them up. &#8220;There are four&mdash;yes, five pairs of
saddle pouches. Come, now,&#8221; and he ran his
eyes over his neighbors until they rested upon
Ben, still laughingly, &#8220;let us see if you can
tell which is your own and which are your
friends&#8217;.&#8221;</p>

<p>Nat, with a start, grasped the man&#8217;s idea
instantly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ezra placed the message to Dr. Warren in
his saddle pocket,&#8221; he said to himself. &#8220;This
man in some way knows of it, and is taking
this means of making sure which are Ezra&#8217;s.&#8221;</p>

<p>It was plain that Ben Cooper did not altogether
relish being selected to make what
the stranger called the test. While the boy
never dreamed of the real truth, as it flashed
into Nat&#8217;s brain, still there was something in
the man&#8217;s manner that did not please him&mdash;a
cunning and a mockery, well hidden, but
present nevertheless. However, he did not
see how he could well refuse, so he set about
the task without further ado.</p>

<p>&#8220;The pair at the end I do not know, so I
suppose they must be yours, sir,&#8221; said he.
&#8220;Next are Mr. Revere&#8217;s, because they are of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">[200]</span>
polished leather, and next are Ezra&#8217;s because
they are of pigskin and almost new&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Wait, wait!&#8221; interrupted the smiling
stranger. &#8220;Which of your friends is Ezra?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That is my name, sir,&#8221; answered young
Prentiss steadily enough.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah!&#8221; said the other, and he looked at
him searchingly. &#8220;Thank you.&#8221; And as
Ben told off the other two pairs of saddle-bags
the speaker added: &#8220;Well, well, you have
sharp eyes, young gentleman. I did not think
it could be done so easily.&#8221;</p>

<p>During the above, Nat had not devoted all
his attention to the stranger. Ezra had come
in for his share of observation, and the boy
from the mountains saw the various changes
of expression that had flashed over his face.
At the first reference to the saddle-bags by the
tall man, Ezra had glanced at him quickly&mdash;and
there was something in the glance that
was puzzled and hesitating. But as the other
proceeded the boy grew slightly pale and Nat
saw his lips come together in a tight line.</p>

<p>And as the others talked and laughed, Nat
pondered the subject in his own mind carefully.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_201">[201]</span>&#8220;It is plain to me,&#8221; he told himself, &#8220;that
these men are met here for the purpose of
possessing themselves of Mr. Adams&#8217; letter.
But why has it been necessary for them to go
to all this trouble if Ezra is in league with
them? Why could he not have arranged to
meet one of them quietly and hand over the
document without further bother? It would
have been much simpler, much easier and
much safer.&#8221;</p>

<p>This point puzzled him for a space; then
the possible reason for all the plotting came to
him like an inspiration.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have it,&#8221; he thought. &#8220;If the message
were delivered to these people secretly, Ezra
would be held accountable&mdash;he would be suspected.
If some show is made of taking it
from him against his will, with all of us as
witnesses, he can easily convince his employers
that he did all he could to safeguard it.&#8221;</p>

<p>This idea grew and took shape in Nat&#8217;s
mind. And he began to suspect that the tall
man&#8217;s attempt to pass himself off as a sympathizer
with the colonies had not been so clumsy
after all. It was possible that he might have
thrown himself open to suspicion intentionally,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_202">[202]</span>
so that in the end, if he succeeded
in securing the paper, it could be shown that
there had been a systematic plan laid and
carried through for its possession.</p>

<p>&#8220;If this is so, it is very ingeniously and
carefully laid,&#8221; thought the boy. &#8220;And I
must keep my eyes wide open.&#8221;</p>

<p>After supper they remained in the inn parlor
talking with the two strangers for a time; at
length Revere, looking at a massive silver
watch that he carried, said:</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s coming nine o&#8217;clock, lads. Let&#8217;s to
bed. We&#8217;ll needs be up in the morning early
to get a good start.&#8221;</p>

<p>Willingly enough the three boys arose and
began gathering up their belongings. Nat
saw the hungry eyes of the two men upon the
pigskin saddle-bags, which now hung from
Ezra&#8217;s arm, and he smiled grimly.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s one thing to want a thing and
another thing to get it,&#8221; he muttered. &#8220;You
may get Mr. Adams&#8217; message in the end, my
friend, but if you do, you&#8217;ll have harder work
of it than you think.&#8221;</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XV<br />


<small>HOW THE PROMISE WAS KEPT</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">But</span> that Nat Brewster was not the only
one who had noticed something odd in the
evening&#8217;s proceedings was made evident as
they all four ascended the wide stairs of the
inn. Lowering his voice to a husky whisper,
Paul Revere said:</p>

<p>&#8220;On the road it&#8217;s best, my lads, to pin
your confidence upon no one&mdash;unless you are
sure who he is.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Hello,&#8221; said Ben Cooper, &#8220;what&#8217;s brought
that out?&#8221;</p>

<p>Revere held up his flaring candle, for the
landlady had provided each of them with
one; the light danced in their faces and up
and down upon the walls and ceilings, throwing
their distorted, gigantic shadows along the
staircase.</p>

<p>&#8220;Nothing,&#8221; answered the horseman of the
Suffolk Convention, &#8220;but the caution of an
old traveler. I say nothing against any one,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_204">[204]</span>
mind you; but it is well to be careful. The
sweetest spoken person is not always the one
most to be trusted.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I think I get your meaning,&#8221; spoke Ezra
Prentiss. &#8220;You are of the opinion that the
man below is not altogether to be trusted.&#8221;</p>

<p>They had reached the landing upon the
second floor; the rooms which they were to
occupy were just at hand. Revere made a
gesture with the lighted candle that caused
the shadows to crouch and then spring madly
apart.</p>

<p>&#8220;I repeat,&#8221; said he, &#8220;that I say nothing
against any one. However, it would be just
as well to keep your eye upon this.&#8221;</p>

<p>As he uttered the last word he struck the
pigskin saddle-bags smartly with his hand
and nodded his head wisely.</p>

<p>&#8220;I think it&#8217;s very good advice,&#8221; said Ben
Cooper, thoughtfully.</p>

<p>&#8220;And I,&#8221; remarked Ezra. &#8220;Good-night,
Mr. Revere, and thanks. Good-night, Nat.&#8221;</p>

<p>Good-nights were said and they entered
their rooms. Ezra and Ben were to occupy a
large room in which were a pair of huge
four-poster beds. Nat and Revere had separate<span class="pagenum" id="Page_205">[205]</span>
rooms, but as it happened, there was a communicating
door between.</p>

<p>The man placed his candlestick upon the
top of a chest of drawers.</p>

<p>&#8220;I never saw a finer or more careful lad
than Ezra,&#8221; he remarked, &#8220;but I&#8217;d as leave
Mr. Adams had given me his errand to do.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why?&#8221; and Nat Brewster turned his
head, looking at the speaker with interest.</p>

<p>&#8220;Only that a person of years is naturally
more cautious,&#8221; returned Revere. &#8220;Now
take for example the fact that Ezra hung his
saddle pouches upon the wall. Was that not
very like carelessness?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But he had them before his eyes all the
time,&#8221; said Nat.</p>

<p>Revere waved his hand.</p>

<p>&#8220;I grant you that. But it was no way to
do. A person upon an important mission
cannot be too sure.&#8221;</p>

<p>There was a short pause, then Nat said:</p>

<p>&#8220;You did not mistrust the man below at
first, I think.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No; I thought him a hearty fellow
enough. It was when the other arrived that
I noticed something that rang false. He received<span class="pagenum" id="Page_206">[206]</span>
the dark man as though he were a
stranger. But I&#8217;ll hazard a guess that they
knew one another well enough.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I see,&#8221; said Nat; and after that he had a
greatly increased respect for the observation
of Mr. Paul Revere.</p>

<p>As it happened, Revere chose the inner
room, the windows of which opened upon the
courtyard. Nat&#8217;s apartment overlooked the
road and lay next the hall. In a very little
while the boy heard the dismal creaking of
Revere&#8217;s bed as the man climbed into it.
Then, after a great number of yawns, there
came the deep breathing of a person fast
asleep.</p>

<p>But Nat had no desire to follow his example.
He knew that he ought to be rested
for the long journey of the morrow; but his
brain was full of thoughts, his eyes unwinking;
he had never felt so wide awake in his life.</p>

<p>There was a high sky that night and the
stars gleamed clearly; but there was no moon
and things were apt to be more vague and
melt more swiftly into the blackness that
lurked under the fences, trees and at the sides
of buildings. Nat stood at his window looking<span class="pagenum" id="Page_207">[207]</span>
out upon the darkness and waiting for
the sounds that would tell him the strangers
were taking themselves to bed. But as they
seemed in no hurry to do this, the boy soon
fell under the spell of the September night.
Every rustle in the elm across the road was
plain to him; and the rasp of insects, deep in
the grass, came clearly to his ears.</p>

<p>&#8220;I like the nights in this flat country,&#8221; he
said softly to himself. &#8220;Things seem more
distant. They don&#8217;t come crowding upon
you like they do among the hills.&#8221;</p>

<p>Just then the rattle of halyards and spars
sounded from the river, the gleam of a starboard
light came winking over the water in a
long, thin trail and the huge loom of a sail
showed ghostlike against the stars. The romance
of this dim vessel appealed to the boy.
What was she&mdash;where was she bound and
what strange adventures would she bring her
crew before her prow parted the waters of the
Delaware again?</p>

<p>Half dreaming, Nat Brewster continued to
watch; then he was quickly called back to
the present by the sound of footsteps on the
inn stairs. He turned from the window and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_208">[208]</span>
listened. Lightly, swiftly the steps ascended;
a dim glimmer of light from a bedroom candle
was thrown along the hall and entered Nat&#8217;s
room at the transom. But in an instant it
had vanished and the footsteps grew fainter
and finally died away.</p>

<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s gone the other way,&#8221; Nat said to
himself. &#8220;His room is probably at the rear
of the building.&#8221;</p>

<p>As they had stood upon the landing listening
to Revere Nat had noticed that the staircase
was in the center of that wing of the
building and that the hallway ran in either
direction from it.</p>

<p>&#8220;Whichever of them it is,&#8221; muttered the
boy, &#8220;he&#8217;ll be well out of the way, at any rate.&#8221;</p>

<p>For a long time he stood and listened for
the other man. But there were no further
footsteps or sounds of any sort.</p>

<p>&#8220;Strange!&#8221; thought the listener. &#8220;Is it
possible that two really came up that time?
I felt sure that it was only&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>He had gone so far when he suddenly
shrank back from the window. Across the
road he had seen a moving shadow, unquestionably
the dim figure of a man.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_209">[209]</span>&#8220;I have it,&#8221; breathed Nat. &#8220;The second
man is to remain on watch outside. And,&#8221;
with a grim setting of his jaws, &#8220;that proves
to me that there is going to be something attempted,
as I thought.&#8221;</p>

<p>He had laid the long pistol upon a chair
shortly after he had entered the room. Now
he took it up, raised the hammer and renewed
the priming.</p>

<p>&#8220;There is nothing like being sure,&#8221; he
thought. &#8220;And unless I&#8217;m entirely wrong, a
pistol that&#8217;s ready to fire will be a useful
thing to have at hand before very long.&#8221;</p>

<p>Again he fell to waiting. A clock from
some distant part of the hostelry struck eleven
and then midnight. It was some time after
that&mdash;how much, Nat did not know&mdash;for he
had gradually become drowsy&mdash;when a faint
creaking noise suddenly came from the hall.
With the step of a cat he crept to his room
door and laid his ear against its edge to
listen.</p>

<p>He was not mistaken; there was a soft
scuffling sound, much like that which would
be made by a person advancing slowly and
with much caution.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_210">[210]</span>Outside his door the sound ceased, and a
long silence followed. At first Nat was convinced
that the prowler intended to enter his
apartment; but a moment&#8217;s thought showed
him that the man could hardly be working
by chance.</p>

<p>&#8220;The door of the room occupied by Ben
and Ezra directly faces mine,&#8221; was Nat&#8217;s conclusion.
&#8220;It is there he has stopped and it
is there he is going to enter.&#8221;</p>

<p>A faint click&mdash;so faint as to be scarcely discernible&mdash;came
from the other side of the
door. The prowler had lifted the catch and
was probably at that moment standing with
his eyes peering through the darkness into
the opposite room. Nat gave him a moment
to get well within the room; then he grasped
the handle of his own door, slowly and noiselessly
swinging it open.</p>

<p>The hall was dark save for the starlight
that sifted through the window at the front.
But just then there came the crackle of a
tinder-box in the room opposite, as it caught
the spark from a steel. Nat saw a form
crouching close to the floor. Then there was
a swift glance&mdash;a swifter movement and the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_211">[211]</span>
pigskin saddle-bags were in the hands of the
unknown.</p>

<p>So, pistol in hand, Nat stepped into the
doorway.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now then, whoever you are,&#8221; he said in a
loud tone, &#8220;stand steady, or it will be the
worse for you.&#8221;</p>

<p>Instantly the light was extinguished. He
heard the four-posters creak as the sleepers
awoke and sat up; and he was just about to
cry a warning to them when a strong hand
hurled him aside and a dark figure leaped
down the hall toward the window. Nat had
a confused sense of hearing startled voices
calling out; but he did not pause to learn
what they were crying.</p>

<p>&#8220;Stop!&#8221; he shouted. &#8220;Stop, or I&#8217;ll
fire!&#8221;</p>

<p>But the unknown paid no heed. Under
the hall window was a porch roof. Leaping
through the one he gained the other; as he
did so the pistol exploded with a terrific
report and the heavy ball flew by his head.
He was balancing himself upon the edge of
the roof for a leap when Nat sprang out and
upon him. Clutched in each other&#8217;s arms they<span class="pagenum" id="Page_212">[212]</span>
swung backward and forward for a moment
and then fell into the road.</p>

<p>The shock broke their holds. Bruised and
bleeding Nat Brewster staggered to his feet.
Lights were beginning to flash at the inn
windows and eager faces to peer out. The
stranger was also rising; the saddle-bags were
in his hands, and Nat sprang forward to grasp
them, when he received a terrific blow from
behind and fell forward upon his face in the
dust of the road.</p>

<p>Ben Cooper, staring from his bedroom
window, candle in hand, saw the person who
struck the blow raise his bludgeon as though
to deliver a second.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s the stranger with the earrings,&#8221; cried
the boy.</p>

<p>Lights were now shining from various windows
and the roadway before the inn was
dimly illuminated; the man was clearly the
same, and there was a fierce look upon his
face as he steadied himself for the finishing
stroke. But just then came a most tremendous
barking and growling; petrified
with astonishment, Ben saw a great dog
rushing furiously forward from the inn<span class="pagenum" id="Page_213">[213]</span>
yard&mdash;and held in leash by the Porcupine.</p>

<p>The monstrous beast sprang upon the
swarthy man and crushed him to the ground;
dragging the dwarf after it like a feather,
it rushed upon the tall man, who had risen
and was gazing around in a most bewildered
manner.</p>

<p>Then Ben, followed by Ezra, leaped out
upon the porch and thence to the ground; and
though they arrived upon the scene of action
but a moment or two later, it was to find the
two strangers gone, and the Porcupine and
dog masters of the situation.</p>

<p>With the help of Revere they carried Nat
into the inn parlor; the landlady, who was
now up, as were indeed all the people of the
hostelry, began staunching the flow of blood
from a wicked cut in his scalp, all the time
lamenting that such a thing should have occurred
at her house.</p>

<p>&#8220;The villains!&#8221; she said. &#8220;The ungrateful
wretches! I hope they get their deserts!
To strike a poor lad like this&mdash;to attempt a
robbery here&mdash;to run off without settling
their score.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_214">[214]</span>&#8220;Now,&#8221; demanded Ben Cooper of the Porcupine,
who was perched upon the arm of the
settle where Nat lay, &#8220;how on earth did you
come here?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I came to see him,&#8221; answered the misshapen boy,
a catch in his voice.</p>

<p>The landlady gave the speaker a look that
was full of wonder and contained just a little
fear.</p>

<p>&#8220;How he ever came to make up with that
wicked beast, Hector, is more than I can understand,&#8221;
she said to the others. &#8220;I have
had that dog chained in the yard these three
years, and only one or two of us dare go near
him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I can always make friends with dogs,&#8221;
said the dwarf. &#8220;All I need is a chance to
talk to them. And when you put me in the
loft over the stable to sleep my window was
just above him; so I had no trouble at all.
When the noise began I knew what it was
right away, and so I made good use of Hector.&#8221;</p>

<p>Here Nat opened his eyes and began to
stare bewildered about him. Revere, Ben
and the landlady bent over him, but Ezra
looked keenly at the dwarf.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_215">[215]</span>&#8220;When the noise began you knew what it
was,&#8221; repeated he. &#8220;How was that?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Never mind,&#8221; replied the dwarf, coolly.
&#8220;I knew; so let that be enough.&#8221;</p>

<p>Nat&#8217;s wits came slowly back to him during
this time, and he painfully grasped each fact
as it presented itself to him. The struggle
with the stranger came first&mdash;then, finally,
the object of the man&#8217;s visit.</p>

<p>&#8220;The saddle-bags!&#8221; he cried, starting to his
feet.</p>

<p>&#8220;Are gone,&#8221; replied Ben Cooper in a
startled tone, for in his anxiety for Nat this
important fact had been forgotten.</p>

<p>Nat&#8217;s eyes went accusingly toward Ezra; he
had not fully recovered from the shock of the
blow and the boy&#8217;s figure was seen through a
sort of haze.</p>

<p>&#8220;And the message?&#8221; spoke Nat, in an unsteady
voice.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is safe,&#8221; replied Ezra Prentiss, quietly.
&#8220;I have it here in my pocket.&#8221;</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XVI<br />


<small>THE TALL MAN BRINGS A FRIEND</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">At</span> the announcement of Ezra, his companions
gazed at him in surprise.</p>

<p>&#8220;What Mr. Revere said upon the stairs as
we were going to bed,&#8221; said the young New
Englander, &#8220;made quite an impression upon
me. So I had not been buried in the four-poster
long before I found that I could not
sleep so long as the message was where it was.
So I got up, removed it from the bag and put
it under my mattress.&#8221;</p>

<p>Revere was much gratified at this.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now,&#8221; said he, &#8220;that was wisdom. And
I am glad that any words of mine saved you
from such a loss. Always be as careful&mdash;you
will find that it adds to your peace of mind.&#8221;</p>

<p>But Nat Brewster was puzzled, and the look
which he directed at the dwarf showed that
that personage was in the same state of mind.
However, he was in no condition to grapple
with perplexities, so he put the thing from him<span class="pagenum" id="Page_217">[217]</span>
for the time. His head was bandaged and
before long they got back to bed once more.</p>

<p>Next morning the wounded boy had a severe
headache; but toward noon it wore away and
he thought himself fit to travel.</p>

<p>&#8220;But,&#8221; said he, decidedly, to Revere, when
announcing his intentions, &#8220;we&#8217;re going to
be a party of five from now on.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I expected that,&#8221; said the other. &#8220;Ben&#8217;s
been telling me about that little imp that he
calls the Porcupine, and how he rendered you
services of some sort upon other occasions beside
that of last night.&#8221; Then after a pause:
&#8220;So you think of taking him along?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; replied Nat. &#8220;If I can get him a
horse it would be much better; but if not, I&#8217;ll
carry him on mine, as he&#8217;s no great weight.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll see what can be done,&#8221; said Revere.
&#8220;Horse flesh ought to be plenty in these parts;
and that means that it should be cheap.&#8221;</p>

<p>The result was that Nat paid out about all
the money he had for an angular, swift little
bay horse, along with which came a worn
saddle and bridle. The Porcupine received
these evidences of favor with great delight.</p>

<p>&#8220;Maybe,&#8221; said he to Nat, &#8220;I&#8217;ll be a lot of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_218">[218]</span>
trouble on the road, but I&#8217;ll try not to be.
And then,&#8221; with his usual grin, &#8220;I may be
useful again in some way; for as you know
I&#8217;m a pretty handy sort to have around on the
outside.&#8221;</p>

<p>They reached Trenton after dark that night
and by the next were well into the north
Jerseys. They slept one night in New York,
then crossed the little colonies of Rhode Island
and Connecticut into Massachusetts; and at
the end of eight days, were arrived safe at
Boston.</p>

<p>&#8220;And now,&#8221; said Revere, as they paused in
Marlborough Street, near the Old South Meeting
House, &#8220;I must leave you for a time.
Before I sleep this night the members of the
convention must be notified that the Continental
Congress has acted, so that they may
assemble to-morrow to receive its formal
resolutions.&#8221; He shook hands with Nat, Ben
and the Porcupine. &#8220;I shall see you again
before you leave the city, no doubt; if not,
good-bye.&#8221;</p>

<p>As Revere left them, Ezra said:</p>

<p>&#8220;It would be as well that I should deliver
my letter to Dr. Warren, also. Misadventures<span class="pagenum" id="Page_219">[219]</span>
on the road have taught me that a
messenger is never safe until his errand is
done.&#8221;</p>

<p>They turned their horses&#8217; heads in the
direction of Hanover Street, where the great
patriot lived; and in a little while, leaving
their horses in care of the Porcupine, they
were shown into the library, where Dr. Warren
received them. That he was all eagerness
to read the communication from Mr. Adams
was evident, but first he greeted Ben and Nat,
bidding them welcome and directing a
servant to prepare supper for them at once.
When he had seen them comfortable and inquired
eagerly after the cause in Philadelphia,
he said:</p>

<p>&#8220;And now you&#8217;ll pardon me, I know.
Mr. Adams is sure to have matters of moment
to write of.&#8221;</p>

<p>And so, while the lads watched him, he
broke the seals and carefully read the message.
By the way his face lit up they knew that the
news was good, and that the future had a
brighter prospect than the present. When he
had finished, he carefully tore the paper into
fragments.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_220">[220]</span>&#8220;You see,&#8221; said he to the boys, laughing,
&#8220;it is not well for a marked man, such as I,
to have papers about him that will tell so
much. Almost at any time Gage is likely to
take courage and swoop down upon me with
a file of men.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And how are things in Boston, sir?&#8221;
asked Ezra.</p>

<p>An anxious look came into the doctor&#8217;s
fine, worn face. But, for all, there was hope
in it also.</p>

<p>&#8220;Bad enough,&#8221; he answered. &#8220;But the
people hold out wonderfully. The Port Bill
has them upon the verge of starvation; those
of us who were rich are now poor&mdash;those
who were poor are now beggars.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then the law is enforced strictly?&#8221; said
Nat Brewster.</p>

<p>The doctor laughed bitterly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Strictly enough,&#8221; said he. &#8220;The harbor
is covered with British ships of war. And
not only is the city&#8217;s foreign commerce cut
off, but its domestic as well. Let a scow
bring lumber or iron, or a lighter attempt to
land hay from the islands and they are
stopped. If a farmer attempts to ferry over<span class="pagenum" id="Page_221">[221]</span>
his marketings or float his sheep into the
city, the fleet is ever ready to capture or destroy
them.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It is, indeed, a condition of affairs not to
be tolerated,&#8221; remarked Ezra, warmly. &#8220;But
how has Gage treated the people lately?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, fairly enough. But he dare not do
otherwise. The new laws are observed only
in Boston; the whole outlying colony is in
revolt against them, and I think he&#8217;s in fear
that there may be an outbreak before he&#8217;s
ready for it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What do you suppose will be the end of it,
sir?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We must fight!&#8221; answered the doctor,
gravely; &#8220;and to win, we must make preparations.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Good!&#8221; cried Ezra, and the light in his
eyes was that of one who feels deeply. &#8220;And
as for the preparation, I suppose that is still
going forward.&#8221;</p>

<p>Dr. Warren nodded.</p>

<p>&#8220;We have magazines of stores at Concord
and Worcester which are constantly being
added to. Cannon, powder and musket-balls
are being gathered from every possible source.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_222">[222]</span>
The organizations of militia are being
drilled daily; the minutemen, as we have
called them, stand ready to answer the call of
the Committee of Safety, day or night.&#8221;</p>

<p>For a long time the patriot talked to the
boys with simple, unsuspicious directness.
And Nat noticed that he, like Revere and
Mr. Adams, seemed to have perfect trust in
Ezra Prentiss.</p>

<p>That night the boys spent at the &#8220;Green
Dragon,&#8221; an inn much frequented by the
patriotic townspeople. Next day Ezra made
ready to ride to his home, which had been in
Cambridge for the past year or two.</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course,&#8221; he said to Nat, &#8220;what time
you stay about Boston, you will spend as my
guest. So get ready and go out with me
now.&#8221;</p>

<p>But Nat shook his head. It was an awkward
situation, and the young mountaineer
felt it deeply. Suspecting Ezra as he did, he
could not accept his hospitality.</p>

<p>&#8220;You will be a great deal more comfortable
at Cambridge than in the city as it now is,&#8221;
urged Ezra.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have no doubt of that,&#8221; returned Nat.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_223">[223]</span>
&#8220;But there are reasons why I should not go.
However, I thank you for your kindness.&#8221;</p>

<p>The two boys were standing apart upon the
pavement of the Green Dragon; and as Nat
made this answer, Ezra regarded him steadily
with his frank, honest eyes.</p>

<p>&#8220;For the first time in my life I know what
it is to be held at arm&#8217;s length,&#8221; said he.
&#8220;And not only now, but since I first met you.&#8221;</p>

<p>Nat did not reply; and the other resumed:</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know when I&#8217;ve met any one whom
I&#8217;ve more earnestly desired to make my friend
than you. Sometimes I&#8217;ve thought it would
come about; but more often I&#8217;ve thought it
otherwise.&#8221; Nat saw his mouth twitch as he
turned away, adding: &#8220;There may be a reason
for it all; if there is,&#8221; meaningly, &#8220;don&#8217;t forget
that it was no fault of mine.&#8221;</p>

<p>Of course Ben accompanied his friend to
Cambridge. He was vastly surprised when
he learned that Nat was not to bear them
company; but after one or two questions he
subsided; for he had come to understand that
Nat only told those things which he desired
to tell.</p>

<p>And as the two rode away down the street,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_224">[224]</span>
the lad from Wyoming turned to the Porcupine
who sat upon a bench before the
&#8220;Dragon&#8221; and said:</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, midget, what do you think?&#8221;</p>

<p>The little eyes of the dwarf seemed to read
what was in his tall friend&#8217;s mind. He
nodded toward the riders who were now some
distance away.</p>

<p>&#8220;About him?&#8221; he asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well&mdash;yes.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I like him,&#8221; said the Porcupine. &#8220;I like
him same as you do, and same as every one
does. But he&#8217;s got a good many things to explain
before I&#8217;d trust him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I think,&#8221; remarked Nat, soberly, &#8220;that&#8217;s
about what I think too.&#8221;</p>

<p>That afternoon the two paid a visit to Paul
Revere at his shop in North Square; and Nat
had a long talk with the engraver as he
worked industriously at a plate.</p>

<p>&#8220;I can lose no time,&#8221; said the man at the
beginning, by way of apology. &#8220;I&#8217;m taken
away from my work so often now that I must
improve each moment I can snatch.&#8221;</p>

<p>But he talked incessantly just the same;
and Nat learned much of the condition of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_225">[225]</span>
Boston, its conflict with king and parliament,
of its patriotic population, and the vigorous,
if secret, measures taken to oppose the army of
Gage.</p>

<p>&#8220;And now,&#8221; said Revere, at last, pausing
in his work, and surveying Nat with questioning
eyes, &#8220;how would you like to stay on in
a town in such a plight?&#8221;</p>

<p>Nat was rather puzzled as to just how to
take this; but before he could speak, Revere
went on:</p>

<p>&#8220;I had some talk about you with your
cousin as we journeyed along, and he told me
just how it is with you. As far as I can see,
though of course my information is limited,
there is no great call for you to go back to
Philadelphia, just yet.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; Nat replied. &#8220;There is not.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Good!&#8221; exclaimed Revere. He leaned
against his bench and scratched his chin.
&#8220;There are many brawny, ready young men
of excellent courage in the city, I have no
doubt,&#8221; he continued; &#8220;but one must see
them in action before making sure. Such
a one is wanted. Dr. Warren has asked
me to recommend him a youth of quality<span class="pagenum" id="Page_226">[226]</span>
for work that will need to be done in Boston
during the winter.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And you think I would answer?&#8221; inquired
Nat.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am sure you would!&#8221; cried Revere, in
high admiration. &#8220;Have I not seen you in
stress of danger? You were like a rock for
steadiness, and you planned like an old campaigner.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Just what is the work?&#8221; asked Nat.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll tell you another time,&#8221; said Mr. Revere,
and Nat noticed him cast a look in the direction
of the Porcupine, who sat in a high-backed
chair drinking in the conversation.</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t be afraid to trust him,&#8221; said Nat,
warmly. &#8220;I never had a more faithful friend
than he has proven himself.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll speak to Dr. Warren,&#8221; said Revere,
evasively. &#8220;It may be that the need he spoke
of has passed. Come to-morrow at this time
and I&#8217;ll let you know.&#8221;</p>

<p>Nat spent the remainder of the day and
part of the next wandering about the city,
looking curiously upon the closed stores, the
military encampments, the trim looking warships
and transports that rode at anchor in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_227">[227]</span>
river. But more than anything else he was
interested in the people, the quiet, watchful
people, so careful that no one should do anything
that could be in any way considered an
offence to the military. Boston knew that
the day of blood was coming; but when it
came she wanted to be able to say that she
did not strike the first blow.</p>

<p>At about noon on the day following the
departure of Ezra and Ben, Nat paused before
a likely looking coffee-house in Orange Street
not far from Allen&#8217;s Lane.</p>

<p>&#8220;Shall we go on to the &#8216;Dragon&#8217; or shall
we have something here?&#8221; asked he of the
Porcupine.</p>

<p>&#8220;I do feel rather peckish,&#8221; returned the
dwarf, &#8220;and the &#8216;Dragon&#8217; is a long way off.&#8221;</p>

<p>So without more ado, Nat made his way
into the place, followed by his odd-looking
ally. There were oaken tables and chairs
about the main room, and at the side were
others screened by curtains of baize.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;ll be more comfortable here, I think,&#8221;
said Nat, selecting one of these; and so they
seated themselves and made known their wants
to an attentive waiter. As they ate their thick<span class="pagenum" id="Page_228">[228]</span>
barley soup with big pewter spoons and
nibbled at bits broken from a crusty loaf, their
eyes wandered about the great square room
and through the door at the people who passed
so quietly, up and down.</p>

<p>There were some prints upon the wall that
after a little attracted Nat&#8217;s attention; and it
was while examining these that he heard a
sputtering cry from the Porcupine. Turning
his head he found that the latter was
apparently choking upon a morsel of bread and
a mouthful of soup; but at the same time he
was almost frantically pointing through the
open door with his spoon.</p>

<p>Nat turned his gaze in that direction and
his excitement almost equaled that of his
companion when he saw, standing upon the
pavement before the coffee-house, the tall
stranger whom they had encountered at the
Bristol inn.</p>

<p>But instantly Nat&#8217;s excitement left him.
Surprise seldom mastered him; in moments of
danger he usually was at his coolest.</p>

<p>&#8220;Just give that curtain a twitch,&#8221; he said to
the dwarf, who was nearest the hanging folds of
baize. &#8220;I think the gentleman is coming in.&#8221;</p>


<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i_228.jpg" alt="" /></div>
<p class="drop-cap"><i>HE SAW THE TALL STRANGER</i></p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_229">[229]</span>The Porcupine did as directed; and it was
none too soon, for the tall man, who had apparently
paused outside to greet an acquaintance,
strode into the coffee-house, laughing
and slapping his boot leg with a thick, silver-knobbed
cane.</p>

<p>&#8220;And look who is with him,&#8221; whispered
the Porcupine, clutching his friend&#8217;s arm,
almost fiercely.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ezra Prentiss!&#8221; breathed Nat, and sank
back into his chair, his face stern and set.</p>

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_230">[230]</span>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XVII<br />


<small>WHAT NAT HEARD AT THE COFFEE-HOUSE IN<br />
ORANGE STREET</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">As</span> Nat Brewster and the dwarf breathlessly
watched, the newcomers at the coffee-house
in Orange Street were taken in hand by
the same attentive servant who had waited
upon the boys; and he pulled back chairs for
them at a table only a few feet distant. They
briefly made known what they desired and
when the waiter had taken himself off, the
tall man, after surveying his companion, said:</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I suppose you are glad to get back
to Boston?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Can you doubt it?&#8221; laughed the boy, his
elbows upon the table, his chin in his palms.
&#8220;It seems that this is the only place in which
I can accomplish anything.&#8221;</p>

<p>The tall man nodded as though he agreed
perfectly with this saying.</p>

<p>&#8220;It seems so indeed,&#8221; replied he. &#8220;You<span class="pagenum" id="Page_231">[231]</span>
had the long journey to Philadelphia practically
for nothing.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And I don&#8217;t know when I worked harder,&#8221;
said the other. &#8220;But everything seemed
against my success&mdash;especially this Nat Brewster.&#8221;</p>

<p>A sour, vindictive look came into the man&#8217;s
face; his curved nose seemed more hawk-like
than ever and his thin lips were set in a straight
line.</p>

<p>&#8220;As far as I have been able to judge,&#8221; went
on the boy, &#8220;young Brewster is quite a
person.&#8221;</p>

<p>The dwarf jogged Nat&#8217;s elbow and grinned
up at him, but the young mountaineer shook
his head warningly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, he was person enough to give me a
nasty fall from the top of that porch,&#8221; said the
tall man, morosely.</p>

<p>The lad across the table laughed amusedly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Never mind, Chesbrook,&#8221; said he. &#8220;Your
hurts will heal. And then you got them in a
good cause. It&#8217;s not for a lieutenant in
the royal navy to make faces about a few
bruises.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Perhaps,&#8221; remarked Lieutenant Chesbrook,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_232">[232]</span>
&#8220;if it were you that had the same
hurts, you wouldn&#8217;t be so apt to laugh about
them.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Maybe not,&#8221; returned the lad. &#8220;But
Brewster did not get off unmarked.&#8221;</p>

<p>This time the man laughed.</p>

<p>&#8220;That Neapolitan strikes a hard blow,&#8221;
said he.</p>

<p>&#8220;Friend Nat is going about with a bandage
around his head, at any rate. But he is
toughly made, and I think would stand a
great deal of rough usage.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I may put him to the test if he remains in
Boston long,&#8221; said Chesbrook, grimly. &#8220;And
as for that imp who came down upon us with
the dog, I&#8217;ll be the death of him. The bites
which the beast gave me before I could get
out of its reach are worse than the other
injuries by far.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, he&#8217;s a brisk little villain, that dwarf,
for all,&#8221; laughed the boy. &#8220;I wish he were
as fast a friend to me as he is to Nat Brewster.
I could make use of him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But what I complain of worse than anything
else,&#8221; continued the lieutenant, &#8220;is the
fact that all my hurts are for nothing.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_233">[233]</span>&#8220;But you got a pair of very excellent
saddle-bags,&#8221; laughingly.</p>

<p>&#8220;If you had not valued those boys so
lightly,&#8221; complained the lieutenant, &#8220;it would
not have been necessary to resort to this last
plan of yours.&#8221;</p>

<p>The other nodded. The laughter quickly
vanished from his face and an expression of
vexation took its place.</p>

<p>&#8220;You are right,&#8221; he said. &#8220;And as it was,
to have broken into the inn at Bristol and
taken the message by force would have been
the proper way of going about it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t forget that our friend Royce tried
something of the sort only an hour or so
south of the town. His success was no greater
than mine.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He did not count upon resistance. If he
had, there would probably be a different story
to tell.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not count upon resistance!&#8221; The lieutenant
laughed heartily. &#8220;Well, that&#8217;s an
odd sort of way of setting out upon a venture.
He and his men were armed, were
they not? Then they must have thought of
a possible resistance. But,&#8221; sneeringly,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_234">[234]</span>
&#8220;when the time came, they were afraid to
fire.&#8221;</p>

<p>There was a short silence, during which
time their food was served them. When the
waiter had once more departed, the man proceeded:</p>

<p>&#8220;When I got the news of Royce&#8217;s failure in
the matter of the men from Virginia, I lost
faith in him. He allowed himself to be beaten
by a boy and a few grooms.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t think his courage can be doubted.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Perhaps not. But his qualities as a leader
can. If a competent man had been on hand
to carry out that enterprise we would have
broken the heart of this growing rebellion at
one blow.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;So I think, too. But,&#8221; and a deep shade
of anxiety came into the speaker&#8217;s face, &#8220;as
matters stand now, it looks very bad, eh?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;General Gage thinks so, at any rate. You
know when he first arrived to take the governorship
of the colony of Massachusetts Bay,
he had a very poor opinion of Americans. Indeed,
he still pretends to think the same. His
letters to the king&#8217;s ministers, so I hear, still
maintain that the colonists are cowards, that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_235">[235]</span>
they will not fight, that they will not hold
together long enough to make this movement
serious, that they are mere blusterers who
think to bully the king into doing what they
ask. But it&#8217;s common talk aboard ship, at
least, that he&#8217;s grown anxious. When he
sends troops beyond the limits of the city,
though they go bravely enough, with flying
colors and to the music of their bands, he
does not know if they will return alive, or no.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, I&#8217;ve heard that the towns all about
are very determined.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And they show their determination in a
practical way by taking all the ammunition
from the public magazines and hiding it
away for their own use. All the cannon they
can lay hold of are used the same way; those
guns which they have not succeeded in carrying
off, they&#8217;ve spiked or thrown into streams.
And, I may add, that the spirit which sets
mothers, wives and daughters to moulding
musket-balls for a defence of what they call
their country&#8217;s rights, is one hard to put
down.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But why does not General Gage make an
effort to stop all this?&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_236">[236]</span>&#8220;How can he? Massachusetts must first
be overawed by a huge army&mdash;which Gage
has not at command&mdash;before any sort of successful
measures can be taken. To attempt it
now might cost a thousand lives. And I
know,&#8221; added the man, with a grim smile,
&#8220;that you wouldn&#8217;t care to see that.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, no,&#8221; replied the boy, his face going
pale. &#8220;I think that above all else open war
must be prevented.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Gage is willing enough to let matters
stand as they are. He thinks that in the end
the people will become more divided and the
whole matter settle itself. But the Tories
are at him constantly to take measures.
Nothing will do them but that their Whig
neighbors shall be hanged or punished in
some equally vigorous way; and they also demand
that expeditions be sent to suppress the
outlying towns. Up to this time, the governor
has resisted them; but I hardly think he
is man enough to continue to do so.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then for a long time the two ate their food
in silence. Then the man asked:</p>

<p>&#8220;You are living at Cambridge, I suppose.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; replied the other.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_237">[237]</span>&#8220;And still hold yourself in readiness to
answer our call.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You know that I do.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Good! If all in Massachusetts were half
so ready to prevent an outbreak as you, we&#8217;d
need to have no fear of the result.&#8221;</p>

<p>Finally they arose and paid their score.
While awaiting change for the gold piece
which Lieutenant Chesbrook had given the
waiter, that officer asked:</p>

<p>&#8220;But you intend to return to Philadelphia,
do you not?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If there is a message from the Adamses, I
will,&#8221; replied the boy.</p>

<p>And with that their change came; then the
two walked out of the place, while Nat and
the Porcupine sat staring at each other across
their table.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XVIII<br />


<small>IN WHICH DR. WARREN AND PAUL REVERE<br />
LISTEN INTENTLY</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">It</span> was some little time before either Nat
or the dwarf spoke; then the latter said
slowly:</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I suppose you have no more doubts
now. I guess you&#8217;ll think with me that he&#8217;d
only one reason for going to Master Chew&#8217;s
house on the night that I saw him there.&#8221;</p>

<p>Nat&#8217;s face was sternly set and there was a
look in his eyes that was unmistakable.</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; replied he, &#8220;I have no more doubts
now. Ezra Prentiss is all that I have suspected
him to be. But in this he has reached
the end of his rope. I shall keep silent no
longer.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Good!&#8221; exclaimed the Porcupine, his stiff
crest of hair seeming to grow more erect with
excitement. &#8220;But,&#8221; lowering his tone, his
manner changing quickly, &#8220;even now there
is something queer about it all.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_239">[239]</span>Nat looked mutely at the lad for an explanation;
the dwarf went on:</p>

<p>&#8220;There was a plan laid between Ezra and
this naval officer to steal the message of Mr.
Adams, was there not?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Their talk would make it seem so, at all
events,&#8221; replied Nat.</p>

<p>&#8220;Then why was the plan not carried out?
The matter lay in their own hands. If Ezra
Prentiss wanted the message taken, why did
he remove it from the saddle-bags?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That is more than I can say,&#8221; answered
Nat, in a low, brooding voice. &#8220;It has a
very unusual look. Something happened, perhaps,
to show the thing not to be desirable at
the time. Otherwise I cannot account for it.&#8221;</p>

<p>They sat in the Orange Street coffee-house
for some time talking over the matter. Nat
had often before noticed the good sense of the
dwarf and the intelligent expression of his
opinions. But to-day both were so noticeable
that in sheer surprise the young mountaineer
finally said:</p>

<p>&#8220;Porcupine, how old are you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Sixteen,&#8221; replied the dwarf.</p>

<p>&#8220;You must have had pretty good schooling.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_240">[240]</span>&#8220;Five years. A Quaker gentleman sent
me to Master File&#8217;s Academy. But he died
and I had no money to continue any longer,
so back I went to sleeping in doorways, while
I staid in the city, and in barns when I took
to the country.&#8221;</p>

<p>A little later, Nat, looking at the tall clock
which stood in a corner, said:</p>

<p>&#8220;I think I&#8217;d better make my way to North
Square, and see Mr. Revere; and as he seems
disinclined to talk before a third person, you
had better wait for me at the &#8216;Dragon.&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>After leaving the Porcupine to make his
way to the inn, Nat Brewster set into a brisk
pace and in a short time found himself once
more at the house of Paul Revere.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah,&#8221; said that worthy, heartily gripping
him by the hand, &#8220;I was just this moment
thinking of you.&#8221;</p>

<p>Nat sat down upon an oaken bench; the
engraver went on with his work, every now
and then looking up to nod at his caller; but
all the time he talked steadily.</p>

<p>&#8220;Last night,&#8221; he said, &#8220;I saw Dr. Warren
and Dr. Benjamin Church, and I talked with
them about you.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_241">[241]</span>&#8220;Who is Dr. Church?&#8221; asked Nat, who
had never heard of that gentleman before.</p>

<p>Revere&#8217;s face became clouded; a little frown
wrinkled itself across the top of his nose.</p>

<p>&#8220;Dr. Church,&#8221; said he, &#8220;is a well-known
gentleman who has mixed himself much in
the movement. He is a frequenter of my
shop; he has written verses that have appeared
upon some of my prints.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah,&#8221; said Nat, &#8220;a patriot.&#8221;</p>

<p>But Paul Revere shook his head. Lowering
his voice cautiously, he made answer:</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not so sure of that. He is a member
of the Committee of Safety, and, with the exception
of Dr. Warren, is the only person who
is told of the secret doings of the Sons of
Liberty. Yet I don&#8217;t trust him overmuch.
He&#8217;s too friendly with the Tories and, I have
heard, is upon terms with Gage himself.&#8221;</p>

<p>An anxious look crept into Nat&#8217;s face.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, the struggle for liberty is like to be
honeycombed with treachery before it has
fairly begun to live.&#8221;</p>

<p>He was about, there and then, to bring up
the matter of Ezra Prentiss, deeming it a fitting
time; but Revere&#8217;s thoughts drifted back<span class="pagenum" id="Page_242">[242]</span>
to what he had upon his tongue in the first
place.</p>

<p>&#8220;Dr. Warren was most pleased with what
he heard about you,&#8221; said the engraver.
&#8220;More than ever he desires some one in
whom he can trust to be at hand when
wanted. Ordinarily he would call upon me,
but I&#8217;m ofttimes taken up with my own
affairs and cannot attend to the committee&#8217;s
business as I&#8217;d like. He said,&#8221; continued
Revere, &#8220;that he&#8217;d be pleased to have a talk
with you to-night.&#8221;</p>

<p>It was arranged after some further conversation
that Revere was to call for Nat at the
&#8220;Dragon&#8221; about eight in the evening and
then they were to go together to the doctor&#8217;s
house in Hanover Street.</p>

<p>This program was carried out, and they
found the great patriot still at his supper.</p>

<p>&#8220;I had been called out, and am but now returned,&#8221;
he said. &#8220;But I am delighted to see
you both.&#8221;</p>

<p>Nothing would do but that they should
draw up their chairs and join him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Here is an excellent joint,&#8221; smiled he,
&#8220;and a capon pie that will please you if you<span class="pagenum" id="Page_243">[243]</span>
admire cookery. And then we can talk more
comfortably, you see.&#8221;</p>

<p>And though they had just supped, they
again sat down with the doctor. After some
little gossip of a general nature, Revere said:</p>

<p>&#8220;I have been talking to Master Brewster,
doctor, as you suggested. And as he seems
anxious to help in the work, I brought him
to see you.&#8221;</p>

<p>The doctor looked at Nat good-naturedly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mr. Revere is an ardent admirer of yours,&#8221;
said he, &#8220;and has been telling me some of the
misadventures of your journey north. And
I may say that your own part in them has
taken my fancy.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Travelers,&#8221; replied Nat, &#8220;come upon unexpected
things, and must somehow overcome
them. That&#8217;s all I tried to do.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;All!&#8221; cried Revere. &#8220;All! Well, perhaps
so; but it was enough to save all our
lives from the hulking thieves gathered in
that ruin. And again, it required courage to
do what you did to save Mr. Adams&#8217; letter,
even though you failed.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You see,&#8221; said Dr. Warren, laughing;
&#8220;Revere will make you out a hero whether<span class="pagenum" id="Page_244">[244]</span>
you will or no. But,&#8221; and his face grew
graver, &#8220;I think you would be of good service
here in Boston if you could but stay.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If there is need of me,&#8221; said Nat, &#8220;I can
stay.&#8221;</p>

<p>The doctor&#8217;s eyes shone with pleasure.</p>

<p>&#8220;Excellent!&#8221; ejaculated he. &#8220;There is a
promptness and decision about that which I
like. And,&#8221; he proceeded, bending toward
Nat, &#8220;there is much need of you. We have
things to do which require courage and adaptability&mdash;qualities
which I&#8217;m inclined to think
you possess.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am ready to undertake anything that
you think I can do,&#8221; said the lad.</p>

<p>&#8220;Gage and his officers are to be watched.
The British must make no move that shall
not at once be reported to us. Revere has organized
a body of mechanics to patrol the
streets night and day; but we must have some
one for a venturesome task&mdash;to learn what the
governor&#8217;s intentions are before he gives the
command.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How is that to be done?&#8221; asked Nat, puzzled.</p>

<p>&#8220;I will explain some ways in which I think<span class="pagenum" id="Page_245">[245]</span>
it might be done, later,&#8221; said Dr. Warren.
&#8220;Ezra Prentiss was to have taken up this
task; but his being selected by the Adamses
to help in their work at Philadelphia prevented
it. I know that he would have been
successful; and I feel sure that you will.&#8221;</p>

<p>Nat had, after careful deliberation, made up
his mind that before this meeting with Warren
came to an end, he would unburden himself
of all his knowledge of Ezra and lay his
suspicions and the cause of them out for the
judgment of that calm-minded patriot.</p>

<p>As he could imagine no better opportunity
for doing this than the one which now presented
itself, he addressed his host nervously,
across the table.</p>

<p>&#8220;Dr. Warren,&#8221; he inquired, &#8220;how long
have you known Ezra Prentiss?&#8221;</p>

<p>The patriot hesitated, then turned to Revere.</p>

<p>&#8220;How long has it been since you first
brought him here?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Some two years, I should say,&#8221; returned
Revere. &#8220;He&#8217;d but lately joined the Sons of
Liberty, and seemed so warm for the work
that I thought we could find things out of the
ordinary for him to do.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_246">[246]</span>&#8220;And some of the tasks we set him to perform
were very much out of the ordinary,&#8221;
praised Dr. Warren, warmly. &#8220;And I never
expect to see anything more enthusiastically
done.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But,&#8221; insisted Nat, &#8220;do you know nothing
more of him than this?&#8221;</p>

<p>There was something in the boy&#8217;s voice that
made the two men look at him questioningly.</p>

<p>&#8220;I know,&#8221; answered Revere, &#8220;that he is a
native of Boston; but that&#8217;s all. However,
we don&#8217;t ask for pedigrees in these days. For
proof of that witness your own case. Deeds
are what count with us and nothing else.&#8221;</p>

<p>There was a pause. Dr. Warren laid his
knife and fork crosswise upon his plate, sat
well back in his chair and looked at Nat intently.</p>

<p>&#8220;I think,&#8221; said he, at last, &#8220;there is something
back of what you&#8217;ve said.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m going to tell you something,&#8221; said
Nat, with a grave air. &#8220;Something that will
try your credulity, perhaps, but that is nevertheless
true for all that. I ask your attention
and I promise to venture no opinion. I am
going to tell you nothing except what has<span class="pagenum" id="Page_247">[247]</span>
happened and will leave it for you to pass
judgment.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Go on,&#8221; said Dr. Warren.</p>

<p>Thereupon Nat began his tale and related it
much after the fashion in which he had told
it to his uncle. But of course there were the
additional things&mdash;the happenings since they
had left Philadelphia and, most damaging of
all, the scene in the coffee-house only a few
hours before.</p>

<p>Both Warren and Revere listened with the
utmost attention; not once did they interrupt
the boy as briefly and lucidly he sketched the
happenings that had given him so much anxiety.</p>

<p>&#8220;And now,&#8221; he concluded, &#8220;I felt that I
could not withhold this any longer&mdash;that it
was my duty to place the facts before you.
And, as I said at the beginning, I venture no
opinion. I leave it to you to say what it all
means.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What you have told us is most astounding,&#8221;
said Warren, &#8220;and yet there is that in
it which carries conviction. What is your
opinion, Revere?&#8221;</p>

<p>The engraver shook his head.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_248">[248]</span>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know what to say,&#8221; he replied.
&#8220;Ezra has always, as far as I could see, been
worthy of trust. But in the face of all that I
have just now heard&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; and he gestured
helplessly, as though unable to finish the
sentence.</p>

<p>Then the two plunged deeply into the
matter and discussed its every side. Every
now and then they appealed to Nat for the
verification of some fact; and the boy was
greatly relieved to find that not once did they
doubt any feature of his story. At length
Dr. Warren said:</p>

<p>&#8220;To spread this tale abroad would do little
good. In fact, it might do considerable harm;
for the people, you know, are easily struck
with panic. The knowledge that there are
traitors within the lines would have a bad
effect upon many.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But,&#8221; said Nat, &#8220;will it not be much
more harmful to allow this boy to continue
as he is doing? He occupies a position which
endangers&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>But Dr. Warren interrupted him.</p>

<p>&#8220;He will not occupy it for long,&#8221; said he,
quietly. &#8220;I will despatch word to Samuel<span class="pagenum" id="Page_249">[249]</span>
Adams to-morrow detailing everything and
asking him to act upon the matter as he
thinks best. And that will mean only one
thing&mdash;that Ezra Prentiss will be entrusted
with no more important work.&#8221;</p>

<p>It was late at night when Revere and Nat
Brewster left Dr. Warren&#8217;s house and proceeded
along Hanover Street.</p>

<p>&#8220;I never expected to hear anything like
this,&#8221; said the engraver, as he shook his head
sadly. &#8220;I&#8217;d have trusted that boy with my
life if need be.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I can understand that,&#8221; replied Nat. &#8220;And
that is the feeling that made me hold my
tongue till now.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;However,&#8221; spoke the man, &#8220;we have other
matters to think about. It&#8217;s a sore thing to
lose a friend, but we&#8217;ve no time for grieving.
Work is ahead for all of us&mdash;work that
will mean much for the colonies if we can
perform it properly.&#8221;</p>

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_250">[250]</span>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XIX<br />


<small>IN WHICH A WINTER PASSES, BRINGING MANY<br />
THINGS</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> very next night, Nat Brewster was admitted
with all due formality to membership
of that devoted band of patriots known as the
&#8220;Sons of Liberty,&#8221; of which Paul Revere
was a leading spirit. This organization met
in one of the upper rooms of the &#8220;Green
Dragon,&#8221; and the young mountaineer was
astonished to find how complete were their
plans of resistance should the time come when
it should be necessary to take up arms.</p>

<p>Immediately, after another consultation
with Dr. Warren, the boy took up the work
that had been assigned to him.</p>

<p>&#8220;One of the most pressing needs of the
British army now encamped in Boston,&#8221; said
the doctor, &#8220;is for barracks to shelter them
during the coming winter. The artisans of
Boston have refused to undertake the building,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_251">[251]</span>
and so bricklayers, masons, plasterers and
carpenters are largely in demand. If you were
one of these now&#8221;&mdash;and he looked at Nat
speculatively, &#8220;you&#8217;d be able to get inside
the lines and perhaps gather information of
great value to us.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I have done a great deal of rough carpentry,&#8221;
said Nat. &#8220;And though I am no
great mechanic, still, I may do, if they are
badly pressed for men.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Excellent!&#8221; said Dr. Warren, greatly
pleased. &#8220;Lose no time in applying to the
officer in charge.&#8221;</p>

<p>This Nat did, later in the same day; and
his services were snapped up eagerly at much
higher wages than usual.</p>

<p>&#8220;Those villains of Whigs will not take
honest work in the king&#8217;s service,&#8221; complained
the red-faced captain in charge of the
work. &#8220;They&#8217;d rather stand about the streets
meditating treason and throwing black looks
at decent persons who uphold the laws.&#8221;</p>

<p>So during the days that followed Nat sawed,
planed and nailed in the midst of the British
with great energy. And all the time he
watched keenly and listened for any news<span class="pagenum" id="Page_252">[252]</span>
that might be of importance. At night he
patroled the streets with Revere and his
thirty mechanics; and there was little that
escaped their sharp eyes and alert minds, for
they scattered into every part of the town
where they thought there might be a movement
of the king&#8217;s troops.</p>

<p>Nat saw very little of Ben Cooper, and
nothing at all of Ezra for some days; finally
one evening as he sat at supper at the
&#8220;Dragon&#8221; Ben burst in upon him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ezra has been recalled to Philadelphia,&#8221;
he stated. &#8220;He starts in the morning, so be
ready and you can pick us up on the way.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m going to remain in Boston,&#8221; said Nat,
calmly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Going to remain in Boston!&#8221; Ben almost
gasped these words, so great was his astonishment.
&#8220;Why, what for?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I have urgent reasons,&#8221; replied Nat.
Then seeing his cousin&#8217;s reproachful look, he
added, laughingly, &#8220;Well, I suppose I&#8217;ll
have to tell you about it; but you will have
to promise not to say anything to any one&mdash;not
even Ezra.&#8221;</p>

<p>Ben looked at Nat challengingly.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_253">[253]</span>&#8220;I say,&#8221; said he, &#8220;what&#8217;s the matter with
Ezra? Somehow or other you don&#8217;t take to
him very well.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s said something to you, has he?&#8221;
said Nat.</p>

<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s said nothing,&#8221; replied Ben warmly.
&#8220;But I&#8217;ve got eyes and I can see as well as
the next.&#8221;</p>

<p>Nat was silent for a moment. He could
tell Ben nothing of that particular affair because
Dr. Warren had asked both himself and
Revere to keep silent.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll say nothing about your ideas regarding
Ezra and me,&#8221; said he, at last. &#8220;But I
will say, under promise that you tell no one,
that I remain in Boston to carry out some
work required of me by Dr. Warren.&#8221;</p>

<p>Now there was no more ardent patriot
among them all than good-natured Ben
Cooper. So upon hearing his cousin&#8217;s words
he at once gave up all expectation of his accompanying
them south.</p>

<p>&#8220;Very well,&#8221; said he. &#8220;If that&#8217;s the case,
I suppose I&#8217;ll have to leave you here. But
the Porcupine will go back with me, of
course.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_254">[254]</span>&#8220;No,&#8221; said Nat. &#8220;I rather think he wants
to remain. But,&#8221; turning to the dwarf who
sat near him, &#8220;speak for yourself.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll stay with you if you&#8217;ll let me,&#8221; came
the answer promptly.</p>

<p>&#8220;So you see,&#8221; smiled Nat to Ben, &#8220;you
will have the trip all to yourselves. But,&#8221;
with a sudden recollection of what was due to
his uncle, &#8220;I must get you to take a letter
to your father.&#8221;</p>

<p>So while Ben waited, he got a bottle of ink,
a quill and a sheet of thick paper, with which
he set about composing a long letter to Mr.
Cooper. When he finally finished and sealed
it up, he had told everything of importance
there was to tell. Ben remained for some
time talking and then got upon his horse for
the ride to Cambridge.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you know,&#8221; said he, as he mounted
and sat looking down at his cousin, &#8220;that I
rather envy you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Because there is something in the air of
this town that tells me that it&#8217;s here or hereabouts
that the explosion is going to take
place.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_255">[255]</span>&#8220;You are always finding things in the air,&#8221;
laughed Nat.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, if I do, I am generally right,&#8221;
argued Ben. &#8220;Just you wait and see.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then they shook hands and said good-bye;
Ben waved his hand and nodded smilingly to
the Porcupine, who replied with a grin; then
the rein was given the little roan, and she
scampered away down the dimly lit street.</p>

<p>During the whole of the long, gloomy
winter that followed, Nat Brewster saw no
more of his cousin; once there came a letter
from Mr. Cooper in which Ben enclosed a
page of greetings, but that was all.</p>

<p>But Nat had little time to think of these
things. As the winter advanced the situation
became more and more tense. The arming of
the people went steadily on, as did the collecting
of the military stores. Nat, in one capacity
or another, served Dr. Warren and the
Committee of Public Safety continuously; he
kept as close as possible to the British sources
of information and more than once was lucky
enough to secure news that was of great help
to the cause. But the Porcupine was invaluable;
he developed a musical talent, which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_256">[256]</span>
Nat had not suspected, and upon a strange looking
string instrument of his own manufacture
he played and sang Tory ballads at inns and
places where the royalists resorted. In this
way he made himself popular with them and
so gained admittance to places which would
otherwise have been denied him; the result was
that there was scarcely a thing of consequence
talked of among the Tories that escaped him,
or failed to reach the ears of the committee in
due course.</p>

<p>In this way it became known to Warren
and the rest of the patriot committee that
Gage had about despaired of his policy of inaction;
he had made up his mind to disarm
the people and seize their leaders.</p>

<p>&#8220;He has been desirous of having an army
of twenty thousand men before resorting to
this,&#8221; Nat told Dr. Warren in repeating what
he had heard. &#8220;But he has made up his
mind that these will never be sent him, so he
is going to make the attempt with his present
force.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Which is about thirty-five hundred,&#8221; said
Dr. Warren. &#8220;But how is he to proceed, or
haven&#8217;t you heard?&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_257">[257]</span>&#8220;The Porcupine, as it happens, heard that
very subject talked of last night at the &#8216;George
and Griffin.&#8217; Ruggles, the loyalist leader,
has asked General Gage to send troops to
Marshfield to protect the Tories from violence.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No violence is meditated against them,&#8221;
said Warren, sternly. &#8220;That is but a subterfuge
to test the willingness of the people to
permit troops to march into the outlying sections.&#8221;</p>

<p>On January 23d, General Gage sent one hundred
men and three hundred stand of arms to
Marshfield. All Boston, it seemed, was on
the streets to watch the tiny column move
out of the city; and as Nat stood gazing with
interest upon the scene, he was surprised to
see Ezra Prentiss upon the edge of the crowd
at the opposite side of the street. They exchanged
formal salutes, but neither made any
attempt to cross to the other. Nat knew that
the brothers Adams had left Philadelphia at
the adjournment of Congress, but he had
heard nothing of Ezra; and, indeed, had given
him but little thought.</p>

<p>&#8220;That means that we must both be more
careful,&#8221; said the Porcupine, when Nat told<span class="pagenum" id="Page_258">[258]</span>
him of the meeting. &#8220;If he sees you among
the British and me among the Tories, he&#8217;ll be
sure to whisper something in their ears that
will put us in danger.&#8221;</p>

<p>In sending the troops to Marshfield, Gage
feared an outbreak; but when the colonists
merely looked sullenly on and no hand was
raised against the soldiers, the governor grew
elated.</p>

<p>&#8220;They dare not really oppose the king&#8217;s
troops,&#8221; he is reported as saying. &#8220;And when
the spring opens, I&#8217;ll prove it to even themselves.&#8221;</p>

<p>A few brass cannon and gun carriages had
been deposited by the patriots at Salem, and
about a month later Nat, by the merest chance,
learned that Colonel Leslie and a detachment
were to be sent to seize them. At Warren&#8217;s
command the young mountaineer sped to Salem
as fast as the hard-mouthed black would
take him.</p>

<p>It was Sunday morning and the Puritan
town was still and covered with snow. But
within an hour the streets were alive with
citizens, all ready to defend the guns. As the
latter were upon the upper side of North<span class="pagenum" id="Page_259">[259]</span>
Bridge, the draw was raised, and when the
British arrived they could not cross the river.
Several large gondolas lay upon the south
bank. Colonel Leslie at once gave orders that
his men cross in these; as the soldiers moved
toward the boats Nat saw a youth, followed
by several older persons, rush forward, push
the craft into the water and proceed to scuttle
them.</p>

<p>The redcoats waded into the stream and
with their bayonets tried to stop this. The
boy leader lifted an oar with which to defend
himself and then, for the first time, Nat recognized
him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ben Cooper,&#8221; he cried in amazement.</p>

<p>A moment later the boats sank, and their
occupants struck out for the north side, swimming
lustily and uttering derisive cries.</p>

<p>Flushed and angry, Colonel Leslie stood at
the open draw and shouted across at the townspeople:</p>

<p>&#8220;Lower the draw in the name of the king.&#8221;</p>

<p>The Rev. Mr. Bernard, a clergyman of
Salem, stepped forward.</p>

<p>&#8220;Colonel,&#8221; said he, &#8220;I take you for a just
and reasonable man, and one who would not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_260">[260]</span>
wish to stain the Sabbath day with blood.
This is a private way; you have no right to
cross if the owners see fit to object. So go
your way in peace.&#8221;</p>

<p>Leslie had been especially warned by Gage
not to persist if there was danger of bloodshed;
and now the news reached him that
the minutemen from all the country round
had been sent for, and indeed, that the company
from Danvers had just arrived. But he
was a determined officer, and as he had set
out to cross the bridge he made up his mind
to do so.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am going to march my men across,&#8221;
declared he. &#8220;If you will peaceably lower
the draw, I&#8217;ll agree to proceed no more than
thirty rods beyond it. But if you refuse&mdash;well,
you must accept the consequences.&#8221;</p>

<p>Thereupon the draw was lowered; the British
had the empty triumph of crossing; but the
brass guns were safe, and the incoming militia
drew up in line and watched the redcoats
depart, their fifes squeaking dismally, their
drums beating a hollow tattoo.</p>

<p>When all danger was past, Nat began a
search for Ben Cooper. But the swimmers<span class="pagenum" id="Page_261">[261]</span>
had landed some distance below the bridge;
he located a few of them, but Ben was nowhere
to be found.</p>

<p>&#8220;The boy who first started for the boats
was a stranger to us,&#8221; the men told Nat.
&#8220;We never saw him before. But he&#8217;s a
plucky one, whoever he is.&#8221;</p>

<p>All the way back to Boston Nat wondered
over this strange incident.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, I had not thought Ben within hundreds
of miles of Boston,&#8221; he said. &#8220;And
here he pops up in the midst of a thing like
that just passed. However, I suppose he&#8217;ll
hunt me up before long and give an account
of himself.&#8221;</p>

<p>But this Ben did not do; weeks passed and
Nat still heard nothing of him. At last the
latter made up his mind that he had been
mistaken.</p>

<p>&#8220;It couldn&#8217;t have been Ben, or he&#8217;d have
looked me up,&#8221; he reasoned. &#8220;It was the
excitement of the moment that led me astray;
one is apt to imagine all sorts of things at
such times.&#8221;</p>

<p>However, as has been noted before, he had
not much leisure to think over his own affairs.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_262">[262]</span>
With Revere and the thirty faithful mechanics,
who continued to patrol the bleak streets each
night, ever watchful and alert, he gave all his
waking time to the Committee of Safety. And
in pursuance of the change of policy on the
part of their commander, the British grew
aggressively offensive. Once they tarred and
feathered a citizen whom they claimed had
tempted a soldier to desert, and drew him
about the streets upon a dray guarded by
soldiers, their band playing &#8220;Yankee Doodle&#8221;
in derision.</p>

<p>They attended public meetings at the Old
South Church and hissed the speakers. On
the day in March set aside by the Provincial
Congress for fasting and prayer, they pitched
tents near to the meeting-houses and the services
were constantly interrupted by the sound
of drum and fife. The very next day Mr.
Hancock&#8217;s house was assaulted and damaged.</p>

<p>&#8220;All this is to provoke the people to strike
the first blow,&#8221; said Warren.</p>

<p>And thereupon the precautions taken by
their leaders to prevent their doing so were
redoubled.</p>

<p>Some fourteen thousand musket cartridges<span class="pagenum" id="Page_263">[263]</span>
were seized by the British guard as the patriots
endeavored to get them across Boston
neck, and the driver of the wagon was severely
handled. This was on March 18th;
and the same evening a party of officers
attacked the Providence coach.</p>

<p>It was about this time that Nat Brewster
became aware that an enterprise of some moment
was soon to be undertaken by Gage.
There was nothing said openly, no one put it
into words; but there was much whispering
and signaling among the younger officers;
and Nat, whose days were almost all employed
at the barracks or officers&#8217; quarters,
listened with all his ears.</p>

<p>At length, as March neared its end, the
rumor became more definite; and then it was
given a name. The stores at Concord were to
be destroyed!</p>

<p>When Nat excitedly bore this intelligence
to Warren, a guard was at once placed over
the magazines; teams were held in readiness
to carry them away at the first sign of a
British advance. Riders were also despatched
to carry the alarm to all the towns and have
them hold their companies of militia to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_264">[264]</span>
answer any call that might be made upon
them.</p>

<p>Gage now sent out engineer officers to inspect
the state of the towns, to make sketches
and maps of the roads and all possible places
of defence. Bodies of troops were frequently
sent out. On the 30th of March, the first
brigade, numbering some eleven hundred
men, took its way toward Jamaica Plain,
and on their march did much damage by
throwing down stone walls and otherwise
misconducting themselves. Armed to the
teeth, they swaggered through the near-by
towns like ruffians. Little did they dream
what danger they were in. All about them
the country slowly arose; bands of armed
minutemen appeared like magic, and, unseen,
awaited the word. Dr. Warren, watching the
truculent brigade of British from a neighboring
hill, smiled grimly to Paul Revere, who
sat his horse beside him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Let them advance a few miles further, attempt
to destroy a magazine or in any way
abuse our people, and not a man of them will
ever see Boston again.&#8221;</p>

<p>But the time was not yet. In the city, the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_265">[265]</span>
bearing of the king&#8217;s soldiers became more
and more proud; the population, unable to
stand their insults, was slowly drifting into
the country. It became quite dangerous for a
patriot of mark to remain, and, indeed, most
of them had taken their leave of the town
long before. But the gallant Dr. Warren remained.</p>

<p>&#8220;Some one must take the risk,&#8221; said he,
simply. &#8220;And why not I?&#8221;</p>

<p>Gage made every effort to purchase supplies
for camp service; but the people were before
him everywhere; they cut him off both in
Massachusetts and New York. About the
middle of April a reinforcement came, and
the very day of its coming, Nat overheard a
conversation between an ensign and a lieutenant
at a mess table which immediately set
his expectations upon edge. The boy from
Wyoming was fitting a window-sash which
had been much complained of; and as the
two officers were but a half dozen feet from
him, he lost not a word.</p>

<p>&#8220;This is all the general&#8217;s been waiting for,&#8221;
declared the ensign, a youthful, strapping fellow.
&#8220;Now mark my words, he&#8217;ll slip a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_266">[266]</span>
second expedition out upon the Yankees and
capture all the nest-eggs they&#8217;ve been hoarding
so carefully at Concord.&#8221;</p>

<p>The lieutenant shook his head.</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course it&#8217;s for General Gage to do as
he thinks best,&#8221; said he. &#8220;But if I were
asked what I thought about it&mdash;which I&#8217;m
not likely to be&mdash;I&#8217;d tell him to go slow.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, he&#8217;s been going slow since he&#8217;s been
here,&#8221; exclaimed the ensign, &#8220;and what has
it done for him? Not a thing. Here is an
assembly of men, styled the Provincial Congress,
and which is totally unknown to the
constitution, collecting the public moneys.
That alone is enough to arouse him to action;
but when he sees the same moneys invested
in warlike stores to be used against him, he
grows angry. It&#8217;s his duty to stop this and
prevent the calamity of a civil war.&#8221;</p>

<p>The lieutenant nodded.</p>

<p>&#8220;You are right,&#8221; said he, &#8220;so it is; but I
don&#8217;t like the way he&#8217;s going about preventing
it.&#8221; He lowered his voice after a glance
at Nat, and continued: &#8220;Have you heard
that the grenadiers and light infantry have
been relieved from duty?&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_267">[267]</span>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; returned the other, with a laugh.
&#8220;The excuse is that they are to learn some
sort of a new exercise. It&#8217;s a rare good dodge,
for of course they&#8217;re being got ready for a
march.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I fancy you are right,&#8221; nodded the lieutenant.
&#8220;And those boats of the transports,
which were hauled up for repairs, have been
launched again and are now under the sterns
of the men-of-war, ready for service.&#8221;</p>

<p>Late that night, for he always visited Dr.
Warren&#8217;s house at hours when he&#8217;d be little
likely to be seen, Nat Brewster hastened to
Hanover Street. Revere was with the doctor
at the time and they received the news which
he had to tell with set faces.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mr. Hancock and Samuel Adams are at
the house of the Rev. Jonas Clark at Lexington,&#8221;
said Dr. Warren to Revere. &#8220;I shall
wish you to bear a letter to them at daybreak
to-morrow.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I will be ready,&#8221; said Revere.</p>

<p>Nat bore the courier company on the following
morning.</p>

<p>&#8220;The time,&#8221; said Revere, soberly, as they
jogged along, &#8220;is not now far off.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_268">[268]</span>&#8220;I fear not,&#8221; replied Nat. &#8220;If Gage strikes,
we must strike back. And that will mean a
relentless war.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I had some faint foreknowledge of what
you told us last night,&#8221; said Revere. &#8220;The
whisper came to me that Gage intended to
seize Mr. Hancock and Mr. Adams, but just
how or when I did not know until you
came.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If they were taken it would be a worse
blow than the loss of the stores could well
be,&#8221; said Nat, seriously. &#8220;Such an event
will, of course, be especially guarded against.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Right,&#8221; returned the man in the same
tone. &#8220;You may be sure that it will be, if I
have any voice in the matter.&#8221;</p>

<p>The house of the Rev. Mr. Clark was
a wooden one upon a shady street; as it happened
both Mr. Adams and Mr. Hancock
were at home, and they received the news
calmly.</p>

<p>&#8220;We have arranged for just this emergency,&#8221;
said Mr. Hancock. &#8220;There are safe
places at Sudbury and Groton for the stores;
within an hour they shall be on their way.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And no British column, no matter how<span class="pagenum" id="Page_269">[269]</span>
strong, will be able to get that far in search of
them,&#8221; added Mr. Adams, grimly.</p>

<p>Revere and Nat rode back by way of Charlestown,
and here they met Colonel Conant of
the militia, and some other gentlemen warm in
the cause.</p>

<p>&#8220;It puzzles me,&#8221; said Revere, after some
talk, &#8220;how we shall get word across the river
when the troops are about to start.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I had thought of that,&#8221; answered Conant.
&#8220;From where we stand, the tower of Old North
Church is plain to be seen in day-time. When
the troops start, climb to the windows in the
steeple and signal us by flashes of light&mdash;one
if they are going by land, two if by water.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Good,&#8221; praised Revere, &#8220;a fortunate idea,
colonel. We will act upon it. Don&#8217;t forget,&#8221;
as they were going, &#8220;two flashes of a lantern
if they go by water&mdash;one, if by land.&#8221;</p>

<p>When they reported to Dr. Warren he
breathed a sigh of relief.</p>

<p>&#8220;It now only remains for us to keep a strict
patrol,&#8221; he said, &#8220;and give the signals
promptly. Do you,&#8221; to Nat, &#8220;watch like a
hawk. And you,&#8221; to Revere, &#8220;see to it that
your men do the same.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_270">[270]</span>Monday passed, and Nat, still employed at
the officers&#8217; quarters, noted many things that
gave him alarm. Late in the afternoon he
saw a dozen horses brought out and a group
of laughing, chatting officers all ready to
mount.</p>

<p>&#8220;I think,&#8221; said the strapping ensign whom
Nat had heard talk a few days before, and who
now made one of this party, &#8220;that there will
be little need for us to watch the roads. The
Yankees know nothing, and therefore can send
no warning to the peasants in the out-sections.&#8221;</p>

<p>Nat did not desire to hear more. In a
sheltered spot he scribbled a few words upon
the face of a smooth pine block with the point
of a nail; hiding this beneath his coat, he
made his way to a point beyond the barracks.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s lucky that I thought to tell the Porcupine
to hold himself ready to carry a message,&#8221;
he said as he hurried along.</p>

<p>Rounding the far end of the barracks, he
heard a door close, then he caught a quick,
sure tread upon some wooden steps; turning
his head the least bit, he got a glimpse of the
newcomer out of the tail of his eye.</p>


<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i_270.jpg" alt="" /></div>
<p class="drop-cap"><i>HE GOT A GLIMPSE OF THE
NEWCOMER</i></p>

<p>&#8220;Ezra!&#8221; almost cried Nat, in dismay. But<span class="pagenum" id="Page_271">[271]</span>
he choked back the exclamation, lowered his
head and walked steadily on. Even though
his back was now squarely toward the other,
Nat knew that the boy had halted and
was watching him. But it was only for a
moment, then the same light footstep resumed,
now upon the plank walk; and Nat,
with a keen, quick glance over his shoulder,
saw him hurrying away toward the group of
officers who were still gathered, awaiting the
command to mount.</p>

<p>As luck would have it, there was a sharp
turn around some buildings for Nat to make
in order to reach the place where he had told
the dwarf to await him. As he rounded this
he was screened from view and broke into a
run.</p>

<p>With set face he sped forward, not knowing
what another moment would develop. And,
as it happened, the very moment that he
caught sight of the grinning face of the Porcupine,
he also heard the roar of hoofs upon
the planks of the barracks road. In a flash
he tossed the dwarf the pine block.</p>

<p>&#8220;To Dr. Warren&mdash;and get out of sight
quickly!&#8221; he said, hastily.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_272">[272]</span>The keen perceptions of the dwarf grasped
the situation instantly. Clutching the block,
he vanished between two buildings; and Nat,
his head bent, as though totally unconscious
of everything but his own private affairs, continued
on up the street. Nearer and nearer
sounded the hoof beats; then two horsemen
drew up beside him.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XX<br />

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Nat</span> gazed up in assumed astonishment at
the two excited faces that bent over him. He
knew that the dwarf was safely away, and all
his native coolness returned to him.</p>

<p>&#8220;What now, my lad?&#8221; demanded one of
the horsemen, a puffy faced captain of light
infantry. &#8220;Where are you going?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m on my way home,&#8221; answered Nat, innocently
enough.</p>

<p>&#8220;I think,&#8221; said the puffy faced captain,
&#8220;you&#8217;d better delay that for awhile and come
back to the barracks. A few words with you
may do no harm.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Very well,&#8221; agreed Nat, promptly.</p>

<p>And with that he turned and started back
over the road he&#8217;d just traveled. His willingness
to do what was demanded of him seemed
to take the two officers by surprise; the second<span class="pagenum" id="Page_274">[274]</span>
of them, a lank youth with vacant eyes,
drawled:</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, this fellow is too wooden-headed to
be dangerous, captain. That lad must have
been hoaxing us.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s not for us to judge of that,&#8221; replied the
puffy faced man, who seemed a competent officer.
&#8220;Major Pitcairn told us to bring him
back, and that&#8217;s what we are going to do.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, of course,&#8221; the lank youth hastened to
say. &#8220;We&#8217;ll do that surely.&#8221;</p>

<p>So Nat was marched back within the British
lines. Where but ten minutes before there
had been laxity and careless superiority, all
was now tense excitement and bustle. The
group of officers were in the saddle; guards
were being placed at many points where it
had never been deemed worth while to have
them before. Scowling looks met the boy
as he trudged calmly along before the two
riders.</p>

<p>At Gage&#8217;s headquarters they drew up; dismounting,
the officer led Nat past the sentries
into a long room where sat the governor, a
stout, bluff Englishman in undress uniform.</p>

<p>&#8220;Is this the fellow, Pitcairn?&#8221; demanded<span class="pagenum" id="Page_275">[275]</span>
Gage of an immaculately dressed officer across
the table from him.</p>

<p>Major Pitcairn surveyed Nat carefully.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve seen him among the workmen for
some months past,&#8221; said he. &#8220;But I&#8217;m not
sure of anything else.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ask Lieutenant Chesbrook to step in,&#8221;
said General Gage to an orderly who stood at
the door. &#8220;And tell him to bring his friend.&#8221;</p>

<p>In a moment the tall naval lieutenant
stalked into the apartment, and following him
was young Prentiss. Nat met the latter&#8217;s eye
with a steady, accusing gaze. But the Boston
boy did not flinch. He merely gazed back
with inquiring interest, nodded and smiled
genially.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; replied the hawk-nosed lieutenant,
glancing at Nat and replying to a question of
Major Pitcairn&#8217;s. &#8220;That is the person.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You are quite sure, lieutenant, that he is
in sympathy with the rebels?&#8221; asked Gage.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am positive,&#8221; answered Chesbrook.</p>

<p>&#8220;And you?&#8221; turning to the other.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is the same boy,&#8221; replied young Prentiss.</p>

<p>There was a moment&#8217;s silence, broken by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_276">[276]</span>
the rattle of hoofs. At the sound, Gage glanced
at Pitcairn and the major nodded.</p>

<p>&#8220;They are off,&#8221; said he, briefly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Tell Smith to get his men ready with all
despatch,&#8221; commanded Gage.</p>

<p>Pitcairn arose and left the room; then the
governor turned his bluff countenance upon
Nat once more.</p>

<p>&#8220;So, young man, you&#8217;ve been spying upon
us,&#8221; said he, sternly.</p>

<p>Nat saw that there was no use denying anything
that was charged against him. The
best way, so he concluded, was to put a bold
face upon the matter, for it would be as likely
to carry him through as anything else.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; he answered, &#8220;and have also been
doing some rather competent work as a carpenter.
If one is to count against me, I trust
you will not fail to credit me with the other.&#8221;</p>

<p>A smile stole over the British general&#8217;s face.</p>

<p>&#8220;You do not lack coolness,&#8221; said he.
&#8220;But that alone will do little for you. You
admit that you are a spy. Do you know the
fate of such?&#8221;</p>

<p>This last was asked in a sharp, stern way.
Instantly young Prentiss took a quick step<span class="pagenum" id="Page_277">[277]</span>
forward as though to protest, but the hand of
Chesbrook closed upon his arm and drew him
back. A moment later the lad left the room.
Nat looked steadily into the British general&#8217;s
face, paying no attention to this by-play.</p>

<p>&#8220;You mean that spies are shot?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Or hanged,&#8221; added Gage, grimly.</p>

<p>&#8220;In time of war&mdash;yes,&#8221; said Nat. &#8220;But
not at such a time as this. Another thing.
I am not a spy in a strictly military sense.
Such a person would be an enemy to the king&mdash;which
I am not.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No?&#8221; and the governor looked at him
with interest.</p>

<p>&#8220;I came here for the same reason that you
did,&#8221; declared Nat, boldly. &#8220;And that is to
prevent war.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Your argument is ingenious enough,&#8221; said
General Gage, &#8220;but it scarcely meets the facts
solidly. However, I have no time now to examine
you. I&#8217;ll have you put under a guard
for a few days until I get some important matters
off my mind.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If the taking of the colonial stores at Concord
is one of them,&#8221; said Nat, coolly, &#8220;you
may as well rid yourself of it now.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_278">[278]</span>General Gage&#8217;s face was naturally red, but
at this it grew much more so.</p>

<p>&#8220;It seems to me,&#8221; remarked he, with a nod
of the head, &#8220;that your time here has not
been wasted.&#8221;</p>

<p>At this moment Major Pitcairn re&euml;ntered
and the governor turned to him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Pitcairn, see to it that parties are set to
guard all the roads. No one is to leave the city.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Have you learned anything?&#8221; asked the
major, with a quick look at Nat.</p>

<p>&#8220;No. But our young rebel here has set me
thinking that our plan may not be so secret
as we think.&#8221;</p>

<p>Once more Pitcairn disappeared. As he
did so, Lieutenant Chesbrook stepped forward
and saluted.</p>

<p>&#8220;General,&#8221; said he, &#8220;if I may be permitted
to do so, I&#8217;d like to offer a suggestion.&#8221;</p>

<p>Gage glanced at him inquiringly. There
was something in the set of the thin lips and
the expression in the cold, light-colored eyes
that gave the impression that Chesbrook&#8217;s
suggestion might have value.</p>

<p>&#8220;I shall be happy to listen to you,&#8221; answered
the soldier readily.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_279">[279]</span>Lieutenant Chesbrook bowed his thanks.
With his finger-tips on the edge of the table
he said:</p>

<p>&#8220;Some time ago I was detailed by the admiral
for shore duty&mdash;of a certain kind.&#8221;</p>

<p>Gage nodded.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes; the admiral spoke to me of it at the
time. He said that you had peculiar persuasive
powers,&#8221; with a laugh. &#8220;Indeed it was
his opinion that no one could resist you if
you chose to set yourself to convince him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The admiral is most flattering,&#8221; spoke
Lieutenant Chesbrook. &#8220;But then, I&#8217;ve given
him proof upon more than one occasion, so he
speaks from personal knowledge. But what
I was about to say was this: I intend riding
with Lieutenant-Colonel Smith&#8217;s column to-night;
and I think if this boy,&#8221; indicating
Nat, &#8220;were permitted to accompany me, he
would be of considerable service.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;In what way?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;In several&mdash;but more especially in recognizing
and pointing out persons whom it
would be worth while taking into custody.&#8221;</p>

<p>Gage&#8217;s eyes snapped.</p>

<p>&#8220;Bravo!&#8221; exclaimed he. &#8220;That is a most<span class="pagenum" id="Page_280">[280]</span>
excellent idea. It never occurred to me.
Take him, by all means.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Thank you,&#8221; said Chesbrook, and his
cold eyes had an odd expression as they
measured Nat from head to foot.</p>

<p>But in reply to the look, Nat merely
laughed.</p>

<p>&#8220;You surely do not think,&#8221; said he, &#8220;that
I will recognize and point out people, as
you put it, or, betray my friends, as I would
put it, just at your request.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t think when a little matter like
this presents itself. I act, as you will learn at
no distant time,&#8221; replied Chesbrook. &#8220;Recollect,
my lad, I have no great love for you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A small thing like a fall from a porch
roof should not be permitted to sour your
temper so,&#8221; said Nat, evenly. &#8220;I would have
thought that Lieutenant Chesbrook of His
Majesty&#8217;s navy was beyond that.&#8221;</p>

<p>But Chesbrook made no reply to this. The
puffy faced captain called a file of men and
the boy was seized.</p>

<p>&#8220;Be careful of him,&#8221; warned Major Pitcairn,
who had re&euml;ntered in the meantime and to
whom the arrangement had been explained.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_281">[281]</span>
&#8220;Lock him up securely and keep a guard
over him&mdash;a strong guard.&#8221;</p>

<p>The captain and his men saluted. The boy
from Wyoming was placed in the midst of
them and led away.</p>

<p>He was placed in a room in a small stone
building not far from the barracks. This was
generally used for refractory troopers and contained
a chair, a table, and a heavy chain fastened
to the wall, on the end of which was an
iron band which was now locked about Nat&#8217;s
waist.</p>

<p>Hour after hour went by; the footsteps of
the double guard outside his prison door went
steadily up and down; now and then as the
men passed one another their voices were
heard murmuring. Through a small window,
barred and high up in the wall, Nat got
a glimpse of the sky; it was black and a few
pale stars burned against it waveringly.</p>

<p>The boy sat with his head drooped forward
upon the heavy table and the thoughts that
filled his mind were gloomy enough.</p>

<p>&#8220;Suppose,&#8221; reflected he, &#8220;my message did
not reach Dr. Warren; suppose he does not
send Mr. Revere to warn Mr. Hancock and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_282">[282]</span>
Mr. Adams and rouse the minutemen in defence
of Concord. If General Gage can deal
them this blow, the cause of the colonies may
be wrecked.&#8221;</p>

<p>He pictured to himself the dark, midnight
roads; the armed British troopers that
guarded them. All along the route to Lexington,
so ran his vision, the houses of the
colonists were without lights; the inmates
were wrapped in slumber. He imagined the
party of officers riding far ahead with ready
swords and pistols; then came the column of
troops, solid, compact, dark, winding slowly
along the highway like a huge serpent. And
nowhere was there any one to oppose their
progress; nowhere was there a voice raised to
warn the sleeping ones of the danger that was
approaching, slowly, deliberately, like Fate.</p>

<p>It was Nat&#8217;s helpless situation, chained,
locked in a strong room, guarded by watchful
soldiers, that so tinged his thoughts. The
truth was that matters were not nearly so
hopeless as he pictured them.</p>

<p>The Porcupine, breathless, pale of face, had
reached Dr. Warren&#8217;s door. Scarcely could
he reach the knocker, even by standing upon<span class="pagenum" id="Page_283">[283]</span>
his toes; but when he did reach it, its
&#8220;rat-tat-tat&#8221; awoke the echoes in Hanover
Street. It was the doctor himself, anxious,
expectant, who came to the door and received
the queer message. As he read it his mouth
tightened.</p>

<p>&#8220;And where is Nat?&#8221; inquired he.</p>

<p>&#8220;I think they&#8217;ve got him,&#8221; said the Porcupine.
&#8220;They were after him when he passed
me this and told me to run.&#8221;</p>

<p>Warren said nothing to this. Bidding the
dwarf sit down, he scratched off a note and
sealed it.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ll take my horse and ride to North
Square,&#8221; he said quietly. &#8220;Mr. Revere will
still be at home,&#8221; with a glance at the clock.
&#8220;You&#8217;ll give him this note. Don&#8217;t fail. A
great deal depends upon it.&#8221;</p>

<p>In an incredibly short time the dwarf
pulled up at Revere&#8217;s house, and walking in
presented the note, which that gentleman
immediately read. It was past dark by this
time and some candles burned in the room.
Revere twisted the note into a spill, touched
it to a flame and watched it turn black and
crumble away on the floor.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_284">[284]</span>&#8220;I&#8217;ll go with you at once,&#8221; he said
quietly.</p>

<p>So he pulled on his heavy boots, buttoned
his surtout, took up his three-cornered hat
and started back to Hanover Street with the
dwarf. Once there, Warren received them
with great eagerness.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have just sent off William Dawes by the
long way &#8217;round the neck,&#8221; said he.</p>

<p>&#8220;It would be as well,&#8221; spoke Revere, after
some discussion, &#8220;for me to make a personal
examination of things and be sure that the
expedition is really about to start.&#8221;</p>

<p>This was agreed to, and off the engraver
started, the dwarf still with him and riding
Warren&#8217;s horse. They had reached the Common
when they noted considerable movement;
rows of boats were drawn up at the water&#8217;s
edge at the bottom of the Common, each bearing
a light in its bow. Approaching these
were a body of troops armed and equipped as
for a march.</p>

<p>&#8220;That means two flashes of the lantern in
the North Tower,&#8221; said Paul Revere, with a
suppressed laugh. Then as though a thought
had just come to him, he added, in a changed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_285">[285]</span>
tone, &#8220;But suppose by some accident they
do not see the signal?&#8221;</p>

<p>The idea apparently troubled him; for a
moment he stood still; then he turned suddenly
to the Porcupine.</p>

<p>&#8220;You know the sexton of North Church,
do you not?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; came the reply.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ride there at once,&#8221; directed Revere, with
the manner of one who has made up his mind,
&#8220;ask him to give you the lantern which he
has ready, and do you give the signal.&#8221;</p>

<p>Without a word the Porcupine turned the
horse and galloped off over the soft sod toward
the north. Revere hastened toward the
river; at the end of a deserted wharf he uttered
a whistle and two men came forward
from some unseen hiding-place. Without any
explanation being necessary, they drew a dory
from behind some piles; all three got into it
and pulled sturdily across the river.</p>

<p>Upon the farther side they found Colonel
Conant and a group of others upon the bank,
and the militia officer greeted Revere hurriedly.</p>

<p>&#8220;We just now received the signal,&#8221; said he,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_286">[286]</span>
&#8220;and had secured a horse from Deacon Larkin
upon which to send a courier with the news.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll go myself,&#8221; said Revere, promptly,
and he vaulted into the saddle of a strong
looking horse which a lad was holding by the
bridle. &#8220;Tell the deacon that I&#8217;ll ride his
beast as carefully as I can, but not to expect
too much, for speed is the thing that will
count to-night.&#8221;</p>

<p>And then, with a wave of the hand, along
the midnight road, bearing the alarm that was
to awake the whole world to liberty, sped Paul
Revere.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXI<br />


<small>NAT BREWSTER MARCHES WITH PITCAIRN TO
LEXINGTON</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">It</span> was about the time that Revere and the
Porcupine first sighted the troops on the Common
that Nat Brewster heard a rattling at
his prison door; lifting his head he saw it
open and admit the guards, bearing lighted
candles.</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll take that little girdle off you, my
lad,&#8221; said a grizzled sergeant of infantry who
seemed to be in command. &#8220;I suppose you&#8217;ll
not make any objection to that.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m to be removed from here, then,&#8221; spoke
Nat, as the soldiers began unlocking the steel
band that encircled him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; replied the sergeant with a laugh.
&#8220;We thought you&#8217;d need a trifle of fresh air.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Where am I to be taken?&#8221; asked the boy.</p>

<p>But the sergeant shook his head at this.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ask me no questions and I&#8217;ll tell you no<span class="pagenum" id="Page_288">[288]</span>
lies,&#8221; answered he. &#8220;But,&#8221; with a renewal of
his laugh, &#8220;you might ask that navy lieutenant;
perhaps he&#8217;d be pleased to say.&#8221;</p>

<p>The lock of the steel girdle seemed to work
stiffly and the soldiers grumbled and strove at
it angrily.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d not like to have that same lieutenant
in charge of me,&#8221; said a youthful, flaxen-haired
corporal who made one of the party.
&#8220;He&#8217;s a bad one, I can tell you.&#8221;</p>

<p>The grizzled sergeant nodded, watching the
efforts at the lock and frowning at the delay.</p>

<p>&#8220;I think,&#8221; continued the flaxen-haired
corporal, &#8220;that he knows more ways of getting
a groan out of a man than the Grand
Inquisitor himself.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah! I think I understand,&#8221; said Nat,
and his mouth tightened.</p>

<p>&#8220;If he&#8217;s got anything ag&#8217;in you and there&#8217;s
anything he wants to make you tell, you&#8217;ll
understand right enough,&#8221; said the old sergeant,
grimly.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve seen a good bit of punishment since I
joined His Majesty&#8217;s army,&#8221; said the corporal,
who seemed of a talkative disposition, &#8220;but
that naval chap do beat all. Mind how he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_289">[289]</span>
took it out of that private of the forty-seventh
the other day?&#8221; to the sergeant.</p>

<p>&#8220;Torture?&#8221; asked Nat.</p>

<p>&#8220;You may well say so,&#8221; returned the flaxen-haired
one. &#8220;And when he&#8217;d made the private
confess, he took the man charged with
trying to get him to desert and manhandled
him in a way I never heard of before. Did
you see the little parade of tar and feathers
through the streets?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; replied Nat.</p>

<p>&#8220;That was an idea of Chesbrook&#8217;s; sort of a
finishing off, you might call it.&#8221;</p>

<p>Here the band and chain clashed to the
stone floor; with muskets at their shoulders,
the guard fell in line, Nat in their midst.</p>

<p>&#8220;As a last word, lad,&#8221; said the grizzled
sergeant, not unkindly, &#8220;let me say you&#8217;d
better do anything that shipman tells you.
It&#8217;ll save you a lot, perhaps.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Thank you,&#8221; said Nat.</p>

<p>At a sharp word from the sergeant the guard
marched out of the room and into the open
air. There were very few lights; but the
bustle told Nat, at once, that there was something
under way; and then as he saw line<span class="pagenum" id="Page_290">[290]</span>
after line of fully equipped soldiers pass by,
he understood.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s the column being sent to Concord!&#8221;
he breathed. There was a queer tightening
at his heart and throat as he watched the
trained redcoats trudge stolidly toward the
river. Their compact organization was plain;
like a machine they moved at the command of
watchful officers. Behind them were centuries
of discipline and British prestige, proven upon
countless battle-fields. And, at the very best,
there would be to oppose them a but few bands
of roughly organized farmers and workmen,
called hastily from their occupations to take
up arms.</p>

<p>&#8220;What chance have they?&#8221; thought Nat,
gloomily, still burdened with his captivity.
&#8220;Even if they have been armed, what chance
have they?&#8221;</p>

<p>But he had no great time to think over this
or anything else; being led to the line of boats
he was forced into one of them; and in a few
moments was in midstream. The lights of
the &#8220;Somerset&#8221; man-of-war, which lay near
at hand, burned clearly, and the tide was at
young flood. Overhead the moon was like a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_291">[291]</span>
silver disc; and the sprinkling stars wavered
and sparkled like myriads of eyes, gazing
down at the darkness of the world.</p>

<p>The troops were ferried across the river with
a despatch that spoke well for Gage&#8217;s preparations.
Immediately they were formed in
column and the eighteen-mile march to Concord
began.</p>

<p>Nat now found himself well in the rear
under a close guard; near him rode Major
Pitcairn, the commander of the column, Lieutenant-Colonel
Smith and Chesbrook, all of
whom seemed engaged in earnest conversation.
No one spoke to Nat, save now and then the
grizzled infantry sergeant; but at length a
horseman dropped back from the front, dismounted,
gave his steed in care of a soldier
and approached him.</p>

<p>But the young mountaineer&#8217;s head was bent
and he did not notice the newcomer until he
spoke. Then the head went up swiftly; the
darkness hid the scorn in Nat&#8217;s eyes, but
nothing could deny that which was in his
voice.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, it&#8217;s you, Prentiss, is it?&#8221;</p>

<p>The other laughed frankly, honestly. It<span class="pagenum" id="Page_292">[292]</span>
was the same laugh that had caught the fancy
of the cobbler at the ferry road.</p>

<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t make me very welcome,&#8221; said
the New England boy.</p>

<p>&#8220;If there is any reason why I should,&#8221;
spoke Nat, &#8220;just give it a name.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why,&#8221; said the other, &#8220;I can think of
none. From your point of view I suppose I
am a very great rascal, indeed.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There can be no greater crime,&#8221; said Nat,
&#8220;than to turn traitor to one&#8217;s country and
friends.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I agree with you in that,&#8221; said the other,
gravely. &#8220;But,&#8221; and there was a new note
in his voice, &#8220;of what does treachery consist?&#8221;</p>

<p>He did not give Nat an opportunity to
reply, but at once proceeded.</p>

<p>&#8220;Two people may love their country; they
may desire with all their hearts to serve it&mdash;but
each may have a different idea as to how
it should best be done. You, for example,
think that to defy the king and parliament, to
follow the leadership of Messrs. Adams, Hancock,
Warren and their like, to take up arms
against the lawful governor, is to serve the
colonies. But I think the reverse.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_293">[293]</span>&#8220;There can be no doubt of that,&#8221; replied
Nat, drily.</p>

<p>But the other paid no heed to the sarcasm.</p>

<p>&#8220;I, too, desire to see the colonies dealt
justly by,&#8221; he went on. &#8220;I also can see very
plainly the wrongs that have been done
them. But I do not believe in seeking to
right them by any method that will end in
bloodshed. An appeal to the liberal minded
English nation will set everything right.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Has that not been tried?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;In a way&mdash;yes. But not in the right
way. The British mean kindly by us; and if
the Whigs would cease threatening, we&#8217;d
quickly get our rights.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It is not we who threaten,&#8221; said Nat; &#8220;it
is they. You say you do not believe in
methods that might end in bloodshed&mdash;then
what do you think of this present expedition?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It is a peaceable one&mdash;a demonstration
only.&#8221;</p>

<p>The boy said this eagerly, with the manner
of one who is anxious to defend a thing which
he strongly desires to be true&mdash;but of which
he is not altogether convinced.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_294">[294]</span>&#8220;Peaceable!&#8221; Nat laughed, mockingly.
&#8220;Why, there are above a thousand men in
this column, each with musket and bayonet,
powder and ball.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Nevertheless, their errand is peaceful,&#8221;
argued the New England lad. &#8220;We but seek
to take the leaders of this sedition that they
may not tempt the people; we mean to
seize the magazines that no madness may be
committed that would bring on a war.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I begin to see your position,&#8221; said Nat.
&#8220;And so,&#8221; sternly, &#8220;you think that to bring
these things about, any deceit may be practiced,
and treachery resorted to.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Those are hard words,&#8221; said the other,
quietly.</p>

<p>&#8220;But they are true ones. Was it not
treachery to plan the capture of your kind
friends Mr. Adams and his brother by the
Tories? Was it not deceit that you practiced
upon Mr. Cooper and Ben, who trusted you&mdash;upon
Dr. Warren, upon Paul Revere?&#8221;</p>

<p>Near at hand a smoking lantern, borne
upon a pole, threw off a red flare of light; in
this the face of the New England lad took on
a sudden troubled look. He laid his hand<span class="pagenum" id="Page_295">[295]</span>
upon Nat&#8217;s arm and was about to speak; but
at that moment the grizzled sergeant broke in
upon them.</p>

<p>&#8220;Sorry to interrupt, my lads,&#8221; said he, in
his gruff way. Then addressing himself to
Nat, he continued: &#8220;You&#8217;re wanted back
here a piece by Lieutenant Chesbrook. And,&#8221;
lowering his voice so that no one else might
hear, &#8220;now is the time to remember what I
told you in the guard-house awhile ago. I
think you are going to have use for it.&#8221;</p>

<p>The British column had advanced steadily
along the old Charlestown and West Cambridge
road until it had now reached Menotomy.
Lights could be seen flickering at windows; and
as the head of the brigade came on, dark forms
went flitting and vanishing into the night.</p>

<p>But Nat saw none of this; he was hurried
toward the group composed of Lieutenant-Colonel
Smith and his aides, which had
drawn up before Newell&#8217;s tavern. The hoofs
of the horses rang loudly as they stamped
upon the stones; their bridle chains jingled
and they snorted impatiently at the delay.
A party under several officers had just been
sent to enter the inn.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_296">[296]</span>&#8220;My information is positive,&#8221; Nat heard
Lieutenant Chesbrook say to Major Pitcairn,
as he came up. &#8220;The rebel Committee of
Safety met here to-day; and I have not
much doubt but that some of them are
passing the night under the same roof.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll root them out, if they are,&#8221; returned
the immaculate major. &#8220;I suppose you&#8217;ll
know them, if taken?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, but our young friend here will, I
think,&#8221; and Chesbrook waved his hand toward
Nat Brewster.</p>

<p>Just then there came the sound of loud
voices at the inn and the sound of splintering
woodwork as the doors were forced.</p>

<p>&#8220;You give me credit for more knowledge
than I possess,&#8221; said Nat, coolly. &#8220;The
Committee of Safety is largely composed of
gentlemen who are strangers to me.&#8221;</p>

<p>Lieutenant Chesbrook touched his horse
with the spur; in a moment he was at the
boy&#8217;s side and saying in a smooth, persuasive
voice:</p>

<p>&#8220;It would be altogether better for you if
you would not assume that attitude. You
possess information which I want and which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_297">[297]</span>
I mean to have. So you will profit a great
deal by falling in with my desires.&#8221;</p>

<p>But Nat looked up at him and replied,
calmly:</p>

<p>&#8220;I am the person to judge of what is best
for me, Lieutenant Chesbrook.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I think not,&#8221; said the naval officer.
&#8220;You see, you don&#8217;t know just what it will
mean to refuse. I have with me some few
ingenious little contrivances which are much
used upon shipboard in compelling our men
to do that which they are disinclined to do.
So don&#8217;t compel me to bring them out; you&#8217;ll
be sorry for it if you do.&#8221;</p>

<p>There was a stir among a group of officers;
a boyish figure darted through them and
stood beside Nat.</p>

<p>&#8220;Lieutenant!&#8221; cried this person in a warning
voice; and instantly Chesbrook wheeled
in his saddle.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well?&#8221; demanded he, harshly.</p>

<p>&#8220;It was understood between us&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; the boy
got this far when the man interrupted him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Have the goodness not to interfere with
my work, Prentiss,&#8221; said he, sourly. &#8220;This
is no time for boyish notions.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_298">[298]</span>&#8220;But you promised that no one was to be
injured!&#8221; There was a note of pleading in
the lad&#8217;s voice; he clutched the stirrup of the
officer and held tightly to it.</p>

<p>Chesbrook laughed.</p>

<p>&#8220;If you were fool enough to think that
matters of this kind,&#8221; with a wave of the
hand at the marching column, &#8220;could be carried
through like a tea-party, it is no fault of
mine.&#8221;</p>

<p>Nat saw the boy stare up at the speaker,
his face suddenly drawn.</p>

<p>&#8220;Then,&#8221; said he, slowly, making almost
the same gesture as the other, &#8220;this means
war?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course it does!&#8221; rapped out Major Pitcairn.
&#8220;The king&#8217;s troops exist for the purpose
of making war.&#8221;</p>

<p>Before the boy could make reply, an officer
came hastily from the inn.</p>

<p>&#8220;No one there but the servants and such,&#8221;
complained he.</p>

<p>&#8220;Bring them out,&#8221; directed Lieutenant-Colonel
Smith, angrily. &#8220;And bring all of
them.&#8221;</p>

<p>In a few moments a little line of half-dressed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_299">[299]</span>
folk blinked bewilderedly in the
light of the flaring torches as the British officers
narrowly examined them. But they
were so unmistakably what they claimed to
be that they were quickly dismissed.</p>

<p>&#8220;Get back with you!&#8221; cried Lieutenant-Colonel
Smith in a fury. &#8220;And if I ever
hear one word against you regarding harboring
rebels it will be the sorriest day for you
that ever dawned.&#8221;</p>

<p>So with that the officers pressed after the
column; and Nat was once more placed in
the midst of his guard, which went trudging
sullenly forward. And as the &#8220;tramp-tramp&#8221;
grew fainter, the inn people began to laugh.
For safe in an adjoining field were Messrs.
Gerry, Lee and Orne, of the patriot committee.
They had been roused by messengers as the
head of the column passed beneath their bedroom
windows, and had slipped out by a back
door as the British broke their way in by the
front.</p>

<p>As the brigade advanced, guns began to
boom in the distance and bells clanged a
sonorous warning to the countryside.</p>

<p>&#8220;The entire section is up,&#8221; growled the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_300">[300]</span>
commander. &#8220;Some warning must have been
sent after all.&#8221;</p>

<p>After a very few miles, Major Pitcairn was
ordered forward with a body of light infantry.</p>

<p>&#8220;Pick up any one you find on the road and
secure the two bridges at Concord,&#8221; directed
the lieutenant-colonel, curtly.</p>

<p>&#8220;It has a bad look,&#8221; said Pitcairn, as he
sat his horse, awaiting the formation of the
six companies which were to make up his
command. The clangor, dim but continuous,
crept toward them across the level fields; and
for the first time a serious look had settled
upon the faces of the king&#8217;s officers.</p>

<p>&#8220;I fancy,&#8221; said the commander, &#8220;that a
reinforcement would do no harm; indeed,
judging by all the commotion ahead, it might
be of good service.&#8221;</p>

<p>So a rider was despatched instantly to
Boston for additional troops; and as he
dashed eastward, the light infantry battalion
under Pitcairn took its way to the west.
Chesbrook accompanied this advance force,
and Nat, his captors having their original
plan, apparently, still in mind, was ordered
with them also.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_301">[301]</span>&#8220;But I recognize no man that is captured
on the way,&#8221; vowed the boy, his jaw set.
&#8220;Let them do as they will, I&#8217;ll stick to that.&#8221;</p>

<p>Dawn was beginning to streak the east
with lines of gray when Nat made out young
Prentiss forcing his way afoot through the
compact mass of the battalion.</p>

<p>&#8220;It will soon be daylight,&#8221; said he, when
he had approached near enough to speak.</p>

<p>Nat gave a look at the sky.</p>

<p>&#8220;Within an hour,&#8221; returned he briefly.</p>

<p>Somehow his resentment against the New
England boy was not at all as strong as he
thought it should be. Treachery, all forms of
unfaithfulness and deceit had long been Nat&#8217;s
pet aversions, but for all that he could not
lift himself to the pitch of anger that he felt
the other&#8217;s acts deserved.</p>

<p>The rhythmic tramp of the troops continued
and the rattle of equipment was sharp and
distinct in the dawn. Now and then the low
command of a sergeant was heard, but all
other voices were silent.</p>

<p>&#8220;Another hour till daylight,&#8221; said Nat,
after a pause, &#8220;and then, I fancy, we shall see
desperate work!&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_302">[302]</span>&#8220;Do you really believe that?&#8221; asked the
other boy, and his tones were anxious and
eager.</p>

<p>&#8220;I do,&#8221; replied Nat; &#8220;the minutemen are
up. Surely you heard the guns and alarm
bells awhile ago.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, I know. I understand. But,&#8221; hurriedly,
&#8220;the British officers will not fire upon
them&mdash;they will not permit their men to do
so.&#8221;</p>

<p>Nat turned his face toward the speaker
curiously.</p>

<p>&#8220;You seem to be very anxious to make
yourself believe that,&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>&#8220;If I did not believe it,&#8221; replied the other
boy, &#8220;I should not be here.&#8221;</p>

<p>A thought came to Nat like an inspiration.
Lowering his voice to almost a whisper, he
said:</p>

<p>&#8220;I think I understand. You mean that if
you thought they would fire upon the colonists,
you would not be upon the British side.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; returned the other.</p>

<p>&#8220;And that can only mean that you would
be&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; Nat paused without completing the
sentence.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_303">[303]</span></p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i_303.jpg" alt="" /></div>
<p class="drop-cap"><i>THEY CAME WITHIN SIGHT OF
LEXINGTON</i></p>



<p>&#8220;Upon the side of the Provincial Congress,&#8221;
returned the other without the slightest hesitation.</p>

<p>As they marched along the wheel-cut road
toward Lexington, Nat now and then stole a
look at the boy at his side. The pale dawn
made things visible in a dim sort of way, and
the young mountaineer noted that the other&#8217;s
head was bent and that he seemed deep in bitter reflection.
There was something in his manner
that drew Nat powerfully; but in spite of
this, he did not believe in him.</p>

<p>&#8220;He deceived me before,&#8221; thought Nat;
&#8220;and he deceived others to whom he owed
every allegiance. How am I to know but
that this is another attempt to do the same
thing.&#8221;</p>

<p>But he had not a great deal of time to revolve
the situation, for, still in the gray
dawn, they came within sight of the town of
Lexington.</p>

<p>Directly ahead was the village green, with
the town meeting-house facing it. Two thin
lines of men, with rifles in their hands, were
gathered here, and as the British came in
sight, a drum rolled warningly from their<span class="pagenum" id="Page_304">[304]</span>
midst. This sound Pitcairn instantly accepted
as a challenge; and at once the battalion
halted.</p>

<p>&#8220;Load with ball&mdash;prime&mdash;fix bayonets!&#8221;
came the curt commands. Then forward
went the six companies at double quick.</p>

<p>Nat saw Captain Parker of the militia,
whom he knew by sight, and also Sergeant
William Monroe, walking up and down before
the two lines of minutemen; and from
their gestures he knew that they were speaking
encouragingly.</p>

<p>Then, unconsciously, his eyes traveled beyond
the militia; three figures stole from the
shadow cast by an inn near the meeting-house;
two of them bore a square, heavy
looking box between them, and Nat gave a
start of wonder as he recognized them.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mr. Revere!&#8221; he cried, &#8220;and Ben
Cooper!&#8221;</p>

<p>At the same moment he felt a hand touch
his elbow and heard the boy at his side say,
quietly:</p>

<p>&#8220;But the third one&mdash;look at him.&#8221;</p>

<p>The last of the three was a boy; he held a
rifle in his hand and seemed to be guarding<span class="pagenum" id="Page_305">[305]</span>
the two with the box. The face was turned
with eagerness toward the British, and as
Nat&#8217;s eyes fell upon it, he stopped, rooted to
the spot with bewilderment.</p>

<p>For the boy was Ezra Prentiss!</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXII<br />


<small>TELLS HOW A MYSTERY WAS SOLVED AND HOW<br />
VICTORY CAME TO THE COLONIES</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">For</span> an instant only did Nat Brewster stand
still; the British battalion, pushing forward,
forced him on. But as the boy still remained
at his side, Nat clutched him by the arm and
demanded:</p>

<p>&#8220;If that is Ezra Prentiss, who are you?&#8221;</p>

<p>The other looked at him squarely; even
through the trouble that was plain in his face,
a flicker of amusement showed at Nat&#8217;s amazement.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am his twin brother, George,&#8221; he answered,
quietly.</p>

<p>At this Nat was almost overwhelmed once
more. Then his mind began to work like
lightning. He had been mistaken all along.
It was this brother&mdash;this twin, who looked so
astonishingly like Ezra&mdash;who had figured in
all the incidents which he had accepted as
proof of treachery. One by one he began to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_307">[307]</span>
go over them; but just then he was aroused by
Major Pitcairn calling sternly and at the top
of his voice:</p>

<p>&#8220;Disperse, ye rebels! Lay down your
arms!&#8221;</p>

<p>All else was instantly forgotten; the drama
being enacted before his eyes was more compelling
than even his exciting thoughts.
Once more the command rang out:</p>

<p>&#8220;Why don&#8217;t ye lay down your arms, ye
villains! Disperse, I tell you.&#8221;</p>

<p>But the two thin lines of alarm men held
their ground. Then came the report of a
musket; Nat saw a British infantryman, his
piece at his shoulder, the smoke curling from
its muzzle. Another and another shot rang
out from the battalion. Pitcairn, frantic with
passion, turned upon his men and shouted for
them to cease firing. But it was too late.</p>

<p>A scattered volley came from the rifles of
the minutemen; Pitcairn&#8217;s horse went down
with a crash, and the bullets drove above the
massed infantry, doing no other harm. Then
the British began platoon firing, in regular
order, calm, methodical and effective. The
patriots responded from behind stone walls<span class="pagenum" id="Page_308">[308]</span>
and other sheltered places which they had
now broken for; and as the leaden messengers
began to whistle about his ears, Nat heard a
voice say:</p>

<p>&#8220;I think we had better get out of this. It
is getting a little too warm for comfort.&#8221;</p>

<p>It was Ezra&#8217;s brother who spoke; and as
he saw Nat dart a quick glance about at the
soldiery, he added:</p>

<p>&#8220;They are too much engaged now to pay
any attention to us. But we must be quick.&#8221;</p>

<p>So with that the two darted out of the road
and behind some buildings. Like deer they
raced along the streets, now filled with terrified
women and weeping children.</p>

<p>The firing abruptly ceased; and in another
moment they noted a little body of minutemen
in retreat across a swamp to the north of
the Common. Upon a piece of rising ground
the boys halted; they saw a full score of dead
and wounded lying upon the village green
and the huzzas of the British came faintly to
their ears.</p>

<p>&#8220;You see,&#8221; said Nat. &#8220;I was right.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And I was wrong,&#8221; answered the other.
&#8220;I was wrong from the beginning. But,&#8221;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_309">[309]</span>
with a sudden lift of the head, &#8220;they have not
yet reached the end. Chesbrook and some
others deceived me shamefully up to this.
But at Concord I&#8217;ll try to prove to them that
they can do so no longer.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Come, then,&#8221; said Nat, briefly. &#8220;Here is
the road. In a little while the British will be
once more on the march.&#8221;</p>

<p>The two lads faced the way to Concord and
went off at a long, swinging lope. The pace
was not a hard one, but it took them swiftly
over the ground. They had covered some two
of the six miles when figures were seen ahead
in the uncertain early light of the April
morning.</p>

<p>&#8220;Halt!&#8221; rang out a sharp voice. They saw
the long barrel of a rifle poked out from
behind a tree at the wayside and cover them.
But only for a moment. Then there was a
sharp exclamation, the muzzle was lowered
and a form leaped into the road.</p>

<p>&#8220;George!&#8221; cried a voice.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ezra!&#8221; replied Nat&#8217;s companion; and the
next instant the two brothers stood with
clasped hands, looking into each other&#8217;s eyes.
But after a moment Ezra turned to Nat.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_310">[310]</span>&#8220;Now,&#8221; said he, gravely. &#8220;You understand?&#8221;</p>

<p>Nat held out his hand.</p>

<p>&#8220;I beg your pardon,&#8221; said he, simply, as
they shook hands. &#8220;But,&#8221; as the thought
came to him, &#8220;why did you not explain it all
when you saw that I suspected you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If I had,&#8221; spoke Ezra, &#8220;is it a thing you
would have believed?&#8221;</p>

<p>Nat reflected and then shook his head.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is more than likely not,&#8221; he replied.</p>

<p>As the brothers turned to each other once
more and began to speak low and earnestly
together, Nat looked expectantly along the
road to where he had seen the figures ahead.
They were now coming anxiously toward
him, and with delight he recognized Paul
Revere and Ben Cooper. Advancing to meet
them, he gripped their hands warmly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hot work back there,&#8221; said Revere, nodding
his head in the direction of Lexington.</p>

<p>&#8220;You succeeded in arousing the towns, I
see,&#8221; spoke Nat.</p>

<p>&#8220;Thanks to your message to Dr. Warren&mdash;yes.
But I almost made a failure of it at the
very start; for I had not gone far on the road<span class="pagenum" id="Page_311">[311]</span>
through Charlestown, when two British
officers, who seemed to be patroling the road,
popped out upon me. But Deacon Larkin&#8217;s
horse was a good one, and I escaped, going
through Medford and alarming almost every
house on the way to Lexington. At Clark&#8217;s,
where you and I went together a few days
ago, I roused Mr. Hancock and Mr. Adams;
and while they were getting ready to leave,
William Dawes, who was also sent out to
spread the alarm, arrived. He and I set off
to Concord to continue our work, and on the
road met a young man named Prescott who
agreed to give us his help.</p>

<p>&#8220;A little farther along here,&#8221; and Revere
pointed up the road, &#8220;the other two stopped
at a house to awake a man; but I rode on,
and I had scarcely gone two hundred yards
when I ran suddenly into a nest of British
officers who clapped pistols to my head and
bid me stop.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And you did?&#8221; laughed Ben Cooper.</p>

<p>&#8220;Can you doubt it?&#8221; asked Revere. &#8220;But
let me go on. They took down some bars and
led me into a pasture; there they threatened
me with pistols once more and demanded to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_312">[312]</span>
know who I was and upon what errand I was
riding.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But you did not tell them,&#8221; said Nat.</p>

<p>&#8220;I did,&#8221; declared Revere, proudly; &#8220;and
in return I suffered great abuse. But one of
the officers seemed much of a gentleman, for
he said to me that none should do me harm.
What I told them seemed to startle them
much; they started toward Lexington with
me in the midst of them, my horse being led
and a man with a drawn pistol on each side
of me. We were nearing a meeting-house
when we heard a gun fired and a bell begin to
ring.</p>

<p>&#8220;Then they took my horse and dashed
away toward Cambridge, leaving me standing
in the road. I returned at once to Clark&#8217;s.
Mr. Hancock and Mr. Adams had not yet
gone, and I warned them of what had occurred.
They departed at once from the
house, I going with them several miles on the
way. Mr. Hancock then told me of a trunk
filled with papers which he had left at the
village inn and asked me if I&#8217;d return for it.
After I had rested a bit, I did so and Ezra
and Ben bore me company.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_313">[313]</span>&#8220;And where did you come upon them?&#8221;
asked Nat.</p>

<p>&#8220;They were at Mr. Clark&#8217;s when I returned
there, and were urging Mr. Adams and his
friend to flee.&#8221;</p>

<p>Nat turned to Ben, a question in his eye.
But Ben laughed.</p>

<p>&#8220;I know what you&#8217;re going to ask me,&#8221; he
said. &#8220;But I&#8217;ll not answer, for I think,&#8221;
with a nod of the head toward the Prentiss
brothers, who stood some little distance off,
&#8220;there is a great deal for you to hear, and as
my little story is mixed up with it, you&#8217;d better
hear all together.&#8221;</p>

<p>Nat noticed that while Revere and Ben
both kept casting marveling glances at the
twins, neither of them seemed greatly astonished.</p>

<p>&#8220;Is it possible that you have known of this
twin brother all along?&#8221; he demanded.</p>

<p>&#8220;Not I,&#8221; and Revere shook his head. &#8220;I
heard of him for the first time last night.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And I,&#8221; said Ben Cooper, &#8220;never knew of
his existence until after I left Boston last
fall.&#8221;</p>

<p>They were all three looking attentively at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_314">[314]</span>
the brothers when the latter turned. Nat
Brewster never saw a more delighted look
upon the face of any one than was upon that
of Ezra Prentiss at that moment.</p>

<p>&#8220;He looks,&#8221; whispered the young mountaineer
to Ben, &#8220;as though the most pleasant
thing in the world had happened to
him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You have no trouble telling one from the
other, then,&#8221; smiled Ben.</p>

<p>&#8220;Not now. Together I can see a difference.
But,&#8221; hesitatingly, &#8220;if they were separated I
might be puzzled once more.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s usually the case in the matter of
twins,&#8221; said Ben.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ben,&#8221; said Ezra, as they came up, &#8220;this is
my brother George&mdash;George, this is Ben
Cooper, and Mr. Revere.&#8221;</p>

<p>The three named shook hands; then Ezra
continued, addressing Nat and Revere:</p>

<p>&#8220;There is a great deal to explain to you and
to others of my friends, who have seen and
heard things that&mdash;that they have not understood.
Ben has known something of it, but
as you two have not, I&#8217;ll begin at the beginning;
and if there are any places where the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_315">[315]</span>
light does not strike, don&#8217;t hesitate to speak
of it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Excuse me,&#8221; interrupted Paul Revere.
&#8220;But there is a chest of important papers in
the bushes some little distance up the road,
that needs careful carrying to Concord. And
as the British may happen along at any time
now we&#8217;d better be off with it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You are right,&#8221; said Ezra, &#8220;and the story
will keep until we get under way.&#8221;</p>

<p>The five hastened forward; the chest was
dragged from its hiding-place; Nat and
Revere each seized a handle and off they set,
trudging manfully. They had gone but a little
distance when Nat said to Ezra:</p>

<p>&#8220;Now for it; I&#8217;m so full of curiosity that I
can wait no longer.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You see,&#8221; began Ezra, &#8220;George has been
brought up by our grandfather, who is a
Tory. All his friends have been king&#8217;s men
and he has been taught to believe in British
rule. As for myself, I have always been a
strong Whig like my father&mdash;so strong a
one,&#8221; and he colored a little, &#8220;that I never
spoke of my brother, fearing that some one
would learn of his way of thought.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_316">[316]</span>&#8220;I was always as strong an American as
you, Ezra,&#8221; said George, smiling. &#8220;Our
methods were different, that&#8217;s all.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Perhaps so,&#8221; answered Ezra. &#8220;But, you
know, it is how we apply our beliefs that
counts.&#8221; Addressing himself to the others,
he went on: &#8220;When the trouble commenced,
George began acting with our enemies. I
pleaded with him, but he would not listen.
He said I had been led away by demagogues&mdash;for
such he had been taught to believe Mr.
Adams and Dr. Warren. When I set out for
Philadelphia I learned that he had formed
the plan to take John and Samuel Adams on
the road and that he was ahead of me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And you left your party as it neared the
city,&#8221; said Nat, understanding, &#8220;that you
might overtake him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Exactly,&#8221; said Ezra, eagerly.</p>

<p>And then he went on to account for his
absence from the City Tavern at Philadelphia
on the night that Ben first called to see him,
in the same way. George had laughingly
told him that Washington and Henry would
soon be prisoners, and not daring to inform
any one of the facts for fear and shame of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_317">[317]</span>
what might befall his brother, Ezra had set
about to follow him and thwart the plan
alone.</p>

<p>Nat laughed when Ezra came to their conversation
upon the pavement before the City
Tavern, in Philadelphia.</p>

<p>&#8220;And to think that you were only trying
to tell me that Washington and his friends
would probably remember my work to my
advantage and that the Tories would do the
reverse,&#8221; said he. &#8220;I understood it as a
threat. When you referred to it afterward
on the road to Bristol you meant, I see now,
to show that you were grateful to me. But
do you know, I was convinced just the other
way about.&#8221;</p>

<p>The boy that the Porcupine had seen leave
the Cooper place in the night and make his
way toward Cliveden had, of course, been
Ezra, still in search of his brother; but the
one whom he saw in consultation with Mr.
Chew and Mr. Dimisdale had been George.
The nervousness of Ezra upon the road to
Bristol was because he feared just what Nat&#8217;s
keen eyes showed to exist&mdash;an ambush. He
had begged Revere to take an unfrequented<span class="pagenum" id="Page_318">[318]</span>
road, thinking to escape one; but the Tories
had out-thought him.</p>

<p>&#8220;I knew from your cold manner,&#8221; said
Ezra to Nat, &#8220;that you believed me guilty of
treachery; but I could not explain it to you,
as you can now see. But Mr. Adams knew
all, for I had told him everything; and when
Dr. Warren&#8217;s letter reached Philadelphia he
was, of course, not surprised. However, we
thought it best to keep the matter strictly to
ourselves. I told Ben a part, as I have said,
that he might be enabled to work with me
intelligently when we returned to Boston the
second time.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We had formed a compact,&#8221; said Ben,
laughing and turning to George, who had been
listening soberly, only now and then adding
a few words to the story, &#8220;to save you from
the British. And we&#8217;ve been quietly on your
trail ever since we came north.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I felt that some one was,&#8221; returned George.
Then he reached out and put his hand upon
Ezra&#8217;s shoulder. &#8220;So all the things that I
have done have fallen upon you!&#8221; he said
with feeling. &#8220;Forgive me, Ezra, if you can;
and believe me that the possibility of such a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_319">[319]</span>
thing never entered my mind until this
morning.&#8221;</p>

<p>For answer, Ezra patted him upon the back
encouragingly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Never mind that,&#8221; said he. &#8220;It&#8217;s all
over now.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; returned George, firmly; &#8220;it&#8217;s all
over; and anything I do in the future, Ezra,
even so warm a patriot as yourself will not be
ashamed of.&#8221;</p>

<p>Now and then they were overtaken by
horsemen, or wagons containing people, heading
for Concord; and Nat smiled to see that all
bore rifles and that their faces wore looks of
determination.</p>

<p>&#8220;There were only a few of us at Lexington,&#8221;
cried a young farmer as he tore by upon a
plough horse, &#8220;but there will be a different
story to tell farther on.&#8221;</p>

<p>Now and then the strong box changed
hands; but the five never stopped for anything
else, tramping steadily on until they
sighted the town.</p>

<p>Concord at that time was a fair-sized place
and contained a church, a jail and a court-house.
There were two spans across the river,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_320">[320]</span>
one called the Old South and the other
the Old North Bridge. The parade ground
was near the meeting-house, and upon
it were companies of minutemen, their
ranks constantly swelling, and even now
being put through their routine by
careful officers. Anxious inquiry on the
part of Revere told them that the last
of the stores had been carted away to safe
hiding-places hours before; and also that
the militia at Lincoln was already upon the
ground.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now,&#8221; said Nat to Ben Cooper, after Mr.
Hancock&#8217;s property had been placed in security,
&#8220;let us stand close together in whatever
befalls. Because if you get away from me
again, of course you&#8217;ll not take the trouble to
hunt me up.&#8221;</p>

<p>The latter part of this speech was uttered
in a jesting tone, but for all that Ben saw that
his cousin more than half meant it.</p>

<p>&#8220;You know, Nat,&#8221; said Ben, &#8220;it was not
altogether my fault that I did not find you at
once upon my return to these parts. But you
had left the &#8216;Dragon&#8217; and I did not care to
make inquiries of Dr. Warren or Mr. Revere<span class="pagenum" id="Page_321">[321]</span>
because&mdash;well, because I knew that Ezra
would rather I should not.&#8221;</p>

<p>At Revere&#8217;s solicitation, rifles were given to
Ben, George, Nat and himself, also powder
and ball; then they hurried out to join the
patriot band upon the square. A party of the
Lincoln minutemen had gone forward on the
Lexington road to meet the British, but they
now came pouring back into the town.</p>

<p>&#8220;The ministerial troops are only about two
miles away,&#8221; announced the Lincoln captain,
William Smith, &#8220;and they are more than
treble the number of all that we can muster!&#8221;</p>

<p>With that the entire American force fell
back to an eminence behind the town and
formed in two battalions. Colonel Barrett,
who had worked all the night superintending
the removal of the stores, joined them here
and at once placed himself in touch with the
situation.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am none too soon,&#8221; remarked this officer,
pointing with his hanger down the Lexington
road. &#8220;Here they are, and marching as
though they meant to finish us without delay.&#8221;</p>

<p>Sure enough the British had come in sight.
The early sunshine struck their burnished<span class="pagenum" id="Page_322">[322]</span>
arms and they glittered bravely in response;
the red coats, white cross belts and high head
pieces added to the gallant appearance of
the compact column. Hotheads among the
Americans were for at once offering battle.
But the wise Colonel Barrett shook his head.</p>

<p>&#8220;Just now,&#8221; said he, &#8220;they are too strong
for us. Men are flocking in from all points
of the compass; in a short time we&#8217;ll be able
to make a stand, but not yet.&#8221;</p>

<p>So he ordered a retreat across the North
Bridge to another eminence which was about
a mile from the center of the town.</p>

<p>The British advanced into Concord, and at
once the North Bridge was secured by two
hundred men. Six companies were sent to
destroy the magazines of stores, but, for the
most part, found them empty. In the center
of the town they seized and broke open some
threescore of barrels of flour, knocked off the
trunnions of three cannons, burnt some
wheels, newly made for gun carriages, and
also a few barrels of wooden trenchers and
spoons.</p>

<p>While this was going forward, the British
all the while conducting themselves after the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_323">[323]</span>
fashion of people highly amused, the alarm
men were flocking to the hill outside. They
came from Carlisle, from Chelmsford, from
Westford, Littleton and Acton. They were
lined up in rough order to the number of almost
five hundred when several pillars of black
smoke began to mount from Concord, and a
cry of rage at once arose from the colonial
force.</p>

<p>&#8220;They are burning the town!&#8221; was the cry.</p>

<p>Colonel Barrett, who had been calmly
studying the situation, now decided to act.</p>

<p>&#8220;The guard at the North Bridge must be
dislodged,&#8221; said he curtly. &#8220;Who will volunteer?&#8221;</p>

<p>A mighty shout went up. With a face
shining with pleasure, the leader at once told
off the companies he desired for the service.
Major John Buttrick was placed in command,
and to the number of some three hundred,
the party started down the hill in double file
and with trailed arms.</p>

<p>&#8220;You are required to cross the North
Bridge,&#8221; were the commander&#8217;s last words to
Major Buttrick; &#8220;but do not fire upon the
king&#8217;s troops unless they fire upon you.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_324">[324]</span>Nat, Ben Cooper, Ezra and his brother were
all with the party. Nat and Ezra marched
shoulder to shoulder and as they neared the
river, the latter said in a low tone:</p>

<p>&#8220;I suppose this is a more or less dangerous
undertaking, but do you know, I have never
been so glad to do anything in my life.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We are all glad to get a chance to back
up our words, I suppose,&#8221; answered Nat.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s not that altogether,&#8221; said Ezra.</p>

<p>And Nat saw the look which the speaker
gave the unconscious George, who was trudging
determinedly forward, his cartridge box
pulled round ready to his hand.</p>

<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s going to get a chance to prove that
he is a patriot at heart like the rest of us,&#8221;
said Ezra. &#8220;And,&#8221; contentedly, &#8220;I have no
fear but that he will.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Nor I,&#8221; said Nat, assuringly.</p>

<p>The two hundred British were upon the
west side of the river; but upon seeing the
provincials approach, they retired to the east
side and formed for a fight; also a detachment
was sent to tear up the planks of the
bridge.</p>

<p>Seeing that this must be prevented, Major<span class="pagenum" id="Page_325">[325]</span>
Buttrick called upon them to stop, but as they
paid no heed, he said sharply to his command:</p>

<p>&#8220;Forward, lads, at the quick!&#8221;</p>

<p>The colonists increased their pace. Instantly
a rattle of musketry came from the
king&#8217;s men. A fifer in the Acton company
dropped with a bullet through him; almost
immediately Captain Davis and a private of
the same company were killed. Seeing the
deadly effect of the volley, the American
leader cried:</p>

<p>&#8220;Fire, fellow soldiers, fire!&#8221;</p>

<p>The American riflemen at once obeyed; as
the leaden couriers began to whistle about
them the British fell into great confusion and
retreated back upon their main body. With
defiant shouts, part of the colonists crossed
the bridge and took up a position on a hill
commanding the main road; the others, bearing
their dead, returned to their starting point,
and all rested upon their arms watching the
redcoats like hawks.</p>

<p>By this time it was well upon noon, and while
Concord was holding the column in check,
the news of the hostile march of the king&#8217;s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_326">[326]</span>
troops was spreading rapidly through all sections
round about, and hundreds of men were
hastening toward the scene of action. All
the roads that led to Concord were thick
with them; they carried the firelock that perhaps
had fought the Indian and the drum
that beat defiance to the French at Louisburg.
And they were led by men who had served
with Wolfe at Quebec and suffered the rigors
of the seven years&#8217; war.</p>

<p>At noon, Lieutenant-Colonel Smith concluded
that nothing further was to be gained
by an advance; so he gave the word that the
column fall back toward Lexington and
Boston. His left was covered by a strong
flank guard that kept the height that borders
the Lexington road; his right was protected
by a stream of water. They had not gone
very far when they began to understand how
thoroughly the country had been aroused.
It seemed as though men dropped from the
very clouds. From behind every tree, every
stump, every rock, a rifle spat its anger at
them.</p>

<p>Near Hardy&#8217;s Hill, the Sudbury company
attacked the British flank guard; there was a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_327">[327]</span>
fierce fight on the old road north of the schoolhouse.
Here the way was lined with woods
upon both sides and the minutemen swarmed
upon them from this shelter like gnats. A
guard on the left flank was ordered out in
desperation; but it proved only a fairer mark
to shoot at, and was instantly ordered back.</p>

<p>This woody defile stretched away for three
or four miles, and while in it the British suffered
terribly.</p>

<p>&#8220;From their look,&#8221; said Nat Brewster, reloading
his piece and wiping the sweat from
his face, &#8220;they have ceased to regard their
expedition as a sort of excursion.&#8221;</p>

<p>Ezra Prentiss, to whom these words were
addressed, raised his rifle to his shoulder and
its report was added to the din.</p>

<p>&#8220;And, I think,&#8221; said he coolly, as he thrust
his hand into his pocket for another cartridge,
&#8220;that they will never start upon such another
one again.&#8221;</p>

<p>It was at this point that Woburn added one
hundred and eighty men to the little provincial
army; at Lincoln, the Lexington company
again appeared upon the field.</p>

<p>The British carried the greater part of their<span class="pagenum" id="Page_328">[328]</span>
wounded, but the dead were left in the road
behind them. At Lexington, Lieutenant-Colonel
Smith was shot in the leg. Here,
also, the British found that their ammunition
was fast failing; the men were growing so
fatigued as to be almost unfit for service;
confusion began to grow among them and
their officers were compelled at times to
threaten them with drawn pistols, to keep
them in order.</p>

<p>Under the murderous fire sustained by the
Americans the column was at last halted and
formed into a hollow square to await the reinforcement
which Colonel Smith had sent
for at daylight. It was here that Lord Percy,
at the head of three regiments of infantry,
two divisions of marines and carrying two
field-pieces came upon them, harassed, worn
and almost upon the point of surrender.
Percy himself had had no easy time in advancing
to the rescue. He had found the
planks of the Cambridge bridge taken up to
delay his crossing the river; then the patriots
had cut off his provision train and left his
men to the hunger of the march.</p>

<p>At once the field-pieces began to play upon<span class="pagenum" id="Page_329">[329]</span>
the colonists; houses and other buildings
were fired wantonly in Lexington, others
upon the route of the retreat, now resumed,
were broken into and plundered.</p>

<p>Dr. Warren had joined the patriots just
before the arrival of Percy; and in the midst
of the party that came with him the boys
were delighted to find the Porcupine, perched
upon a tall horse and with a huge pistol in
his belt. At sight of them he grinned and
smoothed back his stiff crest of hair.</p>

<p>&#8220;Had quite a time getting here,&#8221; said he,
&#8220;but it&#8217;s worth all the trouble. I&#8217;ve always
wished I&#8217;d have a chance to get in the first
fight, and I hope it&#8217;s come true!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re here in time,&#8221; said Nat, with a
laugh. &#8220;The troops that have just come up
look fresh and full of spirit, so it is not all
over yet.&#8221;</p>

<p>But though Lord Percy had almost two
thousand men in all, he showed no disposition
to do anything but get safely back to
Boston. Dr. Warren rallied the patriots, who
had been shaken by the cannon, and they
pressed relentlessly after the invaders.</p>

<p>&#8220;Keep up a brave heart,&#8221; said Warren to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_330">[330]</span>
the riflemen. &#8220;They began it; but see to it,
lads, that we end it.&#8221;</p>

<p>Through West Cambridge they fought.
Again the British ammunition ran short, and
the field-pieces became silent. At Charlestown
the main body of the patriots hung
upon their rear and another force was marching
upon them from Roxbury, Dorchester and
Milton.</p>

<p>It was sundown when the harassed column
staggered down the old Cambridge road to
Charlestown Neck, fighting every step of the
way, but glad to find protection at last under
the guns of their ships of war. Out of gunshot,
the provincials halted; but there they
hung like a cloud, ominous and dark in the
twilight. Next day the shattered battalions
crossed into the city; and at once the Americans
tightened their line; at once the work
began of making the militia and the minutemen
a compact fighting machine of
the sort whose operations would spell
victory.</p>

<p>It was the next morning that the five
boys stood upon the hill and watched the sun
come up over the city.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_331">[331]</span>&#8220;Well,&#8221; said Nat, &#8220;we&#8217;ve got them walled
up in Boston.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; replied Ezra Prentiss, as his sober
gaze dwelt upon the still slumbering town.
&#8220;And it will not be a great while before we
drive them ever from there.&#8221;</p>

<p>And the events of the days to follow proved
him to be a true prophet.</p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
